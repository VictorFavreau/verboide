introduction








i





this
volume
is
neither
a
diary
nor
a
narrative

to
have
given
it
either


of
these
forms

each
of
which
has
its
obvious
advantages

would
have


extended
it
beyond
all
reasonable
limits

it
is
simply
a
selection
from


my
very
full
memoranda
of
a
series
of
visits
paid
to
different
parts
of


france
during
the
year







these
visits
would
never
have
been
made

had
not
my
previous


acquaintance
with
france
and
with
french
affairs

going
back
now

such


as
it
is

to
the
early
days
of
the
second
empire

given
me
reasonable


ground
to
hope
that
i
might
get
some
touch
of
the
actual
life
and


opinions
of
the
people
in
the
places
to
which
i
went

my
motive
for


making
these
visits
was
the
fact
that
what
it
has
become
the
fashion
to


call

parliamentary
government


or

in
other
words

the
unchecked


administration
of
the
affairs
of
a
great
people
by
the
directly
elected


representatives
of
the
people

is
now
formally
on
its
trial
in
france



we
do
not
live
under
this
form
of
government
in
the
united
states

but


as
a
thoughtless
tendency
towards
this
form
of
government
has
shown


itself
of
late
years
even
in
the
united
states
and
much
more
strongly
in


great
britain

i
thought
it
worth
while
to
see
it
at
work
and
form
some


notion
of
its
results
in
france






republican
switzerland
has
carefully
sought
to
protect
herself
against


this
form
of
government

the
swiss
constitution
of

reposes


ultimately
on
the
ancient
autonomy
of
the
cantons

each
canton
has
one


representative
in
the
federal
executive
council

the
members
of
this


council
are
elected
for
three
years
by
the
federal
assembly

and
from


among
their
own
number
they
choose
the
president
of
the
confederation



who
serves
for
one
year
only

a
provision
probably
borrowed
from
the


first
american
constitution

the
cantonal
autonomy
was
further


strengthened
in

by
the
establishment
of
the
federal
tribunal
on


lines
taken
from
those
of
the
american
supreme
court

there
is
a


division
of
the
executive
authority
between
the
federal
assembly
and
the


federal
council

which
is
yet
to
be
tested
by
the
strain
of
a
great


european
war

but
which
has
so
far
developed
no
serious
domestic


dangers






the
outline
map
which
accompanies
this
volume
will
show
that
my
visits



which
began
with
marseilles
and
the
bouches
du
rhone

upon
my
return


from
rome
to
paris
in
january


on
the
eve
of
the
memorable
election


of
general
boulanger
as
a
deputy
for
the
seine
in
that
month

were


extended
to
nancy
in
the
east
of
france

to
the
frontiers
of
belgium
and


the
coasts
of
the
english
channel
in
the
north

to
rennes

nantes

and


bordeaux
in
the
west

and
to
toulouse

nimes

and
arles
in
the
south

i


went
nowhere
without
the
certainty
of
meeting
persons
who
could
and


would
put
me
in
the
way
of
seeing
what
i
wanted
to
see

and
learning


what
i
wanted
to
learn

i
took
with
me
everywhere
the
best
books
i
could


find
bearing
on
the
true
documentary
history
of
the
region
i
was
about


to
see

and
i
concerned
myself
in
making
my
memoranda
not
only
with
the


more
or
less
fugitive
aspects
of
public
action
and
emotion
at
the


present
time

but
with
the
past

which
has
so
largely
coloured
and


determined
these
fugitive
aspects

naturally

therefore

when
i
sat
down


to
put
this
volume
into
shape

i
very
soon
found
it
to
be
utterly
out
of


the
question
for
me
to
try
to
do
justice
to
all
that
had
interested
and


instructed
me
in
every
part
of
france
which
i
had
visited






i
have
contented
myself
accordingly
with
formulating

in
this


introduction

my
general
convictions
as
to
the
present
condition
and


outlook
of
affairs
in
france
and
as
to
the
relation
which
actually


exists
between
the
third
republic

now
installed
in
power
at
paris

and


the
great
historic
france
of
the
french
people

and
with
submitting
to


my
readers

in
support
of
these
convictions

a
certain
number
of
digests


of
my
memoranda

setting
forth
what
i
saw

heard

and
learned
in
some
of


the
departments
which
i
visited
with
most
pleasure
and
profit






in
doing
this
i
have
written
out
what
i
found
in
my
note
books
less


fully
than
the
importance
of
the
questions
involved
might
warrant

but


what
i
have
written

i
have
written
out
fairly
and
as
exactly
as
i


could

i
do
not
hold
myself
responsible
for
the
often
severe
and


sometimes
scornful
judgments
pronounced
by
my
friends
in
the
provinces


upon
public
men
at
paris

but
i
had
no
right
to
modify
or
withhold


them

in
the
case
of
conversations
held
with
friends

or
with
casual


acquaintances

i
have
used
names
only
where
i
had
reason
to
believe


that

adding
weight
to
what
was
recorded

they
might
be
used
without


injury
or
inconvenience
of
any
kind
to
my
interlocutors






the
sum
of
my
conclusions
is
suggested
in
the
title
of
this
book

i


speak
of
france
as
one
thing

and
of
the
republic
as
another
thing

i
do


not
speak
of
the
french
republic

for
the
republic
as
it
now
exists
does


not
seem
to
me
to
be
french

and
france

as
i
have
found
it

is


certainly
not
republican









ii





the
third
french
republic

as
it
exists
to
day

is
just
ten
years
old






it
owes
its
being

not
to
any
direct
action
of
the
french
people

but
to


the
success
of
a
parliamentary
revolution

chiefly
organised
by
m



gambetta

the
ostensible
object
of
this
revolution
was
to
prevent
the


restoration
of
the
french
monarchy

the
real
object
of
it
was
to
take


the
life
of
the
executive
authority
in
france

m

gambetta
fell
by
the


way

but
the
evil
he
did
lives
after
him






he
was
one
of
the
celebrities
of
an
age
in
which
celebrity
has
almost


ceased
to
be
a
distinction

but
the
measure
of
his
political
capacity
is


given
in
the
fact
that
he
was
an
active
promoter
of
the
insurrection
of


september




in
paris
against
the
authority
of
the
empress


eugenie

a
more
signal
instance
is
not
to
be
found
in
history
of
that


supreme
form
of
public
stupidity
which
president
lincoln
stigmatised

in


a
memorable
phrase

as
the
operation
of

swapping
horses
while
crossing


a
stream







it
was
worse
than
an
error
or
a
crime

it
was
simply
silly

the


inevitable
effect
of
it
was
to
complete
the
demoralisation
of
the
french


armies

and
to
throw
france
prostrate
before
her
conquerors

a
very


well
known
german
said
to
me
a
few
years
ago
at
lucerne

where
we
were


discussing
the
remarkable
trial
of
richter

the
dynamiter
of
the


niederwald


ah

we
owe
much
to
gambetta

and
jules
favre

and
thiers



and
the
french
republic

they
saved
us
from
a
social
revolution
by


paralysing
france

we
could
never
have
exacted
of
the
undeposed
emperor


at
wilhelmshoehe

with
the
empress
at
paris

the
terms
which
those


blubbering
jumping
jacks
were
glad
to
accept
from
us
on
their
knees







the
imbecility
of
september




was
capped
by
the
lunacy
of
the


commune
of
paris
in


this
latter
was
more
than
france
could
bear



and
a
wholesome
breeze
of
national
feeling
stirs
in
the

murders
grim


and
great


by
which
the
victorious
army
of
versailles
avenged
the


cowardly
massacre
of
the
hostages

and
the
destruction
of
the
tuileries


and
the
hotel
de
ville






with
what

mandate


and
by
whom
conferred

m

thiers
went
to
bordeaux


in


is
a
thorny
question

into
which
i
need
not
here
enter

what
he


might
have
done
for
his
country
is

perhaps

uncertain

what
he
did
we


know

he
founded
a
republic
of
which

in
one
of
his
characteristic


phrases

he
said
that


it
must
be
conservative

or
it
could
not
be




and
this
he
did
with
the
aid
of
men
without
whose
concurrence
it
would


have
been
impossible

and
of
whom
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
they
were


fully
determined
the
republic
should
not
be
conservative

he
became


chief
of
the
state

and
this
for
a
time

no
doubt

he
imagined
would


suffice
to
make
the
state
conservative






he
was
supported
by
an
assembly
in
which
the
monarchists
of
france


predominated

the
triumphant
invasion
and
the
imminent
peril
of
the


country
had
brought
monarchical
france
into
the
field
as
one
man

m



gambetta
s
absurd
government
of
the
national
defence

even
in
that


supreme
moment
of
danger
when
the
uhlans
were
hunting
it
from
pillar
to


post

actually
compelled
the
princes
of
the
house
of
france
to
fight
for


their
country
under
assumed
names

but
it
could
not
prevent
the
sons
of


all
the
historic
families
of
france
from
risking
their
lives
against
the


public
enemy

all
over
france
a
general
impulse
of
public
confidence
put


the
french
conservatives
forward
as
the
men
in
whose
hands
the


reconstitution
of
the
shattered
nation
would
be
safest

the
popular


instinct
was
justified
by
the
result






from

to


france
was
governed

under
the
form
of
a
republic

by


a
majority
of
men
who
neither
had

nor
professed
to
have

any
more


confidence
in
the
stability
of
a
republican
form
of
government

than


alexander
hamilton
had
in
the
working
value
of
the
american
constitution


which
he
so
largely
helped
to
frame

and
which
he
accepted
as
being
the


best
it
was
possible
in
the
circumstances
to
get

but
they
did
their


duty
to
france

as
he
did
his
duty
to
america

to
them

first
under
m



thiers

and
then
under
the
marechal
duc
de
magenta

france
is
indebted


for
the
reconstruction
of
her
beaten
and
disorganised
army

for
the


successful
liquidation
of
the
tremendous
war
indemnity
imposed
upon
her


by
victorious
germany

for
the
re
establishment
of
her
public
credit



and
for
such
an
administration
of
her
national
finances
as
enabled
her



in


to
raise
a
revenue
of
nearly
a
thousand
millions
of
francs

or


forty
millions
of
pounds
sterling

in
excess
of
the
revenue
raised
under


the
empire
seven
years
before

without
friction
and
without
undue


pressure

in


the
empire
had
raised
a
revenue
of






francs

in


the
conservative
republic
raised
a
revenue
of






francs

with
this
it
covered
all
the
cost
of
the
public


service

carried
the
charges
resulting
from
the
war
and
its


consequences

set
apart



francs
for
public
works

and
yet


left
in
the
treasury
a
balance
of



francs






it
is
told
of
one
of
the
finance
ministers
of
the
restoration

baron


louis

that
when
a
deputy
questioned
him
once
about
the
finances

he


replied


do
you
give
us
good
politics
and
i
will
give
you
good


finances


it
seems
to
me
that
the
budget
of

proves
the
politics
of


the
conservative
majority
in
the
french
parliament
of
that
time
to
have


been
good

the
marechal
duc
de
magenta
was
then
president

m

thiers
had


resigned
his
office
in


in
consequence
of
a
dispute
with
the


assembly

the
true
history
of
which
may
one
day
be
edifying

and
the


assembly
had
elected
the
marechal
duc
to
fill
his
place






i
have
been
told
by
one
of
the
most
distinguished
public
men
in
france


that

in
his
passionate
desire
to
prevent
the
election
of
the
marechal


duc

m

thiers
was
bent
upon
promoting
a
movement
to
bring
against
the


soldier
of
magenta
an
accusation
like
that
which
led
to
the
condemnation


of
the
marechal
bazaine

and
that
he
was
with
difficulty
restrained
from


doing
this






monstrous
as
this
attempt
would
have
been

it
hardly
seems
more


monstrous
than
the
abortive
attempt
which
was
actually
made

under
the


inspiration
of
m

gambetta
and
his
friends

to
convict
the
marechal
duc


and
his
ministers


the
men
of
the
th
of
may


of
conspiring

while
in


possession
of
the
executive
power

to
bring
about
the
overthrow
of
the


republic
and
the
restoration
of
the
monarchy






m

gambetta
and
his
party
having
formed
in

what
is
known
as

the


alliance
of
the



determined
to
drive
the
marechal
duc
from
the


presidency

to
take
the
control
of
public
affairs
entirely
into
their


own
hands

and
to
reduce
the
executive
to
the
position
created
for
louis


xvi

by
the
revolutionists
of
the
first
republic

before
the
atrocious


plot
of
august




made
an
end
of
the
monarchy
and
of
public
order


altogether

and
prepared
the
way
for
the
massacres
of
september

whether


the
marechal
duc
might
not
have
resisted
this
revolutionary
conspiracy


to
the
end
it
is
not
worth
while
now
to
inquire

suffice
it
that
he
gave


way
finally

and

refusing
to
submit
to
the
degradation
of
the
high
post


he
held

accepted
m

gambetta
s
alternative
and
relinquished
it






it
appears
to
me
that
the
true
aim
of
the
republicans

who
had
carried


the
elections
of

by
persuading
france
that
germany
would
at
once


invade
the
country
if
the
conservatives
won
the
day

is
sufficiently


attested
by
the
fact
that
they
chose

as
the
successor
of
the


marechal
duc

a
public
man
chiefly
conspicuous
for
the
efforts
he
had


made
to
secure
the
abolition
of
the
executive
office






m

grevy
had
failed
to
get
the
presidency
of
the
republic
suppressed


when
the
organic
law
was
passed
in


he
was
more
successful
when

on


january




he
consented
to
accept
the
presidency

when
he
entered


the
elysee

the
executive
authority
went
out
of
it

the
third
french


republic

such
as
it
now
exists

was
constituted
on
that
day

the


anniversary

by
the
way

oddly
enough

of
the
decapitation
of
charles
i



of
england
at
whitehall






that
is
the
date

not

centennial


but

decennial


which
ought
to
have


been
celebrated
in

by
the
third
french
republic

in
his
first


message

february




m

grevy
formally
said


i
will
never
resist


the
national
will
expressed
by
its
constitutional
organs


from
that


moment
the
parliamentary
majority
became
the
government
of
france






something
very
like
this
french
parliamentary
revolution
of

to


which
france
is
indebted
for
the
third
republic
as
it
exists
to
day

was


attempted
in
the
united
states
about
ten
years
before






in
both
instances
the
intent
of
the
parliamentary
revolutionists
was
to


take
the
life
of
a
constitution
without
modifying
its
forms

the
failure


of
the
american
is
not
less
instructive
than
the
success
of
the
french


parliamentary
revolution

and
as
all
my
readers

perhaps

are
not
as


familiar
with
american
political
history
as
with
some
other
topics

i


hope
i
may
be
pardoned
for
briefly
pointing
this
out






upon
the
assassination
of
president
lincoln
in
april

the


vice
president

andrew
johnson

became
president

he
was
a
southern
man



and
as
one
of
the
senators
from
the
southern
state
of
tennessee
he
had


refused
to
go
with
his
state
in
her
secession
from
the
union

to
this
he


owed
his
association
on
the
presidential
ticket
with
mr

lincoln
at
the


election
in


he
was
no
more
and
no
less
opposed
to
slavery
in
the


abstract
than
president
lincoln

of
whom
it
is
well
known
that
he


regarded
his
own
now
famous
proclamation
of

freeing
the
slaves
in


the
seceded
states

as
an
illegal
concession
to
the
anti
slavery
feeling


of
the
north
and
of
europe

and
that
he
spoke
of
it
with
undisguised


contempt

as
a

pope
s
bull
against
the
comet


like
mr

lincoln

andrew


johnson
was
devoted
to
the
union

but
he
was
a
constitutional
democrat


in
his
political
opinions

and
the
civil
war
having
ended
in
the
defeat


of
the
confederacy

he
gradually
settled
down
to
his
constitutional


duty

as
president
of
the
united
states

towards
the
states
which
had


formed
the
confederacy

this
earned
for
him
the
bitter
hostility
of
the


then
dominant
majority
in
both
houses
of
congress

led
by
a
man
of


unbridled
passions
and
of
extraordinary
energy

thaddeus
stevens

a


representative
from
pennsylvania

a
sort
of
american
couthon

infirm
of


body
but
all
compact
of
will

it
was
the
purpose
of
this
majority
to


humiliate
and
chastise

not
to
conciliate

the
defeated
south

already



under
president
lincoln

this
purpose
had
brought
the
leaders
of
the


majority
more
than
once
into
collision
with
the
executive

under


president
johnson
they
forced
a
collision
with
the
veto
power
of
the


president

by
two
unconstitutional
bills

one
attainting
the
whole


people
of
the
south

and
the
other
aimed
at
the
authority
of
the


executive
over
his
officers

in
the
policy
thus
developed
they
had
the


co
operation
of
the
secretary
at
war

mr

stanton

and
during
the
recess


of
congress
in
august

it
became
apparent
that
with
his
assistance


they
meant
to
subjugate
the
executive

president
johnson
quickly
brought


matters
to
an
issue

he
first

during
the
recess

suspended
mr

stanton


from
the
war
office

putting
general
grant
in
charge
of
it

and
upon
the


reassembling
of
congress
in
december


removed

him

and
directed


him
to
hand
over
his
official
portfolio
to
general
thomas

appointed
to


fill
the
place

ad
interim


thereupon
the
majority
of
the
house
carried


through
that
body
a
resolution
of
impeachment

prepared

by
a
committee



the
necessary
articles

and
brought
the
president
to
trial
before
the


senate

constituted
as
a
court
for

high
crimes
and
misdemeanours


two


of
the
articles
of
impeachment
were
founded
upon
disrespect
alleged
to


have
been
publicly
shown
by
the
president
to
congress

the
president

by


his
counsel

among
whom
were
mr

evarts

since
then
secretary
of
state



and
now
a
senator
for
new
york

and
mr

stanberry

an
attorney
general


of
the
united
states

appeared
before
the
senate
on
march




the


president
asked
for
forty
days

in
which
to
prepare
an
answer

the


senate

without
a
division

refused
this

and
ordered
the
answer
to
be


filed
within
ten
days

the
trial
finally
began
on
march


and

after


keeping
the
country
at
fever
heat
for
two
months

ended
on
may


in


the
failure
of
the
impeachment

only
three
out
of
the
eleven
articles


were
voted
upon

upon
each
thirty
five
senators
voted
the
president
to


be

guilty


and
nineteen
senators
voted
him
to
be

not
guilty


as
the


constitution
of
the
united
states
requires
a
two
thirds
vote
in
such
a


trial

the
chief
justice
declared
the
president
to
be
acquitted

and
the


attempt
of
the
legislature
to
dominate
the
executive
was
defeated

seven


of
the
nineteen
senators
voting

not
guilty

were
of
the
republican


party
which
had
impeached
the
president

and
it
will
be
seen
that
a


change
of
one
vote
in
the
minority
would
have
carried
the
day
for
the


revolutionists

so
narrow
was
our
escape
from
a
peril
which
the
founders


of
the
constitution
had
foreseen

and
against
which
they
had
devised
all


the
safeguards
possible
in
the
circumstances
of
the
united
states

what



in
such
a
case

would
become
of
a
french
president






the
american
president
is
not
elected
by
congress
except
in
certain
not


very
probable
contingencies

and
when
the
house
votes
for
a
president



it
votes
not
by
members
but
by
delegations

each
state
of
the
union


casting
one
vote

the
french
president
is
elected
by
a
convention
of
the


senate
and
the
chamber
of
deputies

in
which
every
member
has
a
vote



and
the
result
is
determined
by
an
actual
majority

the
senate
of
the


united
states
is
entirely
independent
of
the
house

a
large
proportion


of
the
members
of
the
french
senate
are
elected
by
the
assembly

and
the


chamber
outnumbers
the
senate
by
nearly
two
to
one

what
the
procedure


of
the
french
senate

sitting
as
a
high
court
on
the
impeachment
of
a


president
by
the
majority
of
the
chamber

would
probably
be

may
be


gathered
from
the
recent
trial
by
that
body
of
general
boulanger






with
the
resignation
of
the
marechal
duc
and
the
election
of
m

grevy


the
government
of
france

ten
years
ago

became
what
it
now
is

a


parliamentary
oligarchy

with
absolutely
no
practical
check
upon
its


will
except
the
recurrence
every
four
years
of
the
legislative


elections

and
as
these
elections
are
carried
out
under
the
direct


control

through
the
prefects
and
the
mayors

of
the
minister
of
the


interior

himself
a
member
of
the
parliamentary
oligarchy

the
weakness


of
this
check
might
be
easily
inferred

had
it
not
been
demonstrated
by


facts
during
the
elections
of
september

and
october









how
secure
this
parliamentary
oligarchy
feels
itself
to
be

when
once


the
elections
are
over

appears
from
the
absolutely
cynical
coolness


with
which
the
majority
goes
about
what
is
called
the
work
of



invalidating

the
election
of
members
of
the
minority

something
of
the


sort
went
on
in
my
own
country
during
the

reconstruction

period
which


followed
the
civil
war

but
it
never
assumed
the
systematic
form
now


familiar
in
france

as
practised
under
the
third
republic
it
revives
the


spirit
of
the
methods
by
which
robespierre
and
the
sections

corrected


the
mistakes

made
by
the
citizens
of
paris
in
choosing
representatives


not
amenable
to
the
discipline
of
the

sea
green
incorruptible


and
as


a
matter
of
principle

leads
straight
on
to
that
usurpation
of
all
the


powers
of
the
state
by
a
conspiracy
of
demagogues
which
followed
the


subsidized
parisian
insurrection
of
august









such
a

regime

as
this
sufficiently
explains
the
phenomenon
of



boulangism


by
which
englishmen
and
americans
are
so
much
perplexed



put
any
people
into
the
machinery
of
a
centralized
administrative


despotism
in
which
the
executive
is
merely
the
instrument
of
a
majority


of
the
legislature

and
what
recourse
is
there
left
to
the
people
but



boulangism



boulangism

is
the
instinctive

more
or
less
deliberate


and
articulate

outcry
of
a
people
living
under
constitutional
forms



but
conscious
that

by
some
hocus
pocus

the
vitality
has
been
taken
out


of
those
forms

it
is
the
expression
of
the
general
sense
of
insecurity



in
a
country
situated
as
france
now
is

it
is
natural
that
this


inarticulate
outcry
should
merge
itself
at
first
into
a
clamour
for
the


revision
of
a
constitution
which
has
been
made
a
delusion
and
a
snare



and
then
into
a
clamour
for
a
dynasty
which
shall
afford
the
nation


assurance
of
an
enduring
executive
raised
above
the
storm
of
party


passions

and
sobering
the
triumph
of
party
majorities
with
a
wholesome


sense
of
responsibility
to
the
nation






there
would
have
been
no
lack
of

boulangism

in
france
forty
years
ago


had
m

thiers
and
his
legislative
cabal
got
the
better
of
the
prince


president
in
the

struggle
for
life

which
then
went
on
between
the


place
st

georges
and
the
elysee









iii





there
are
two
periods

one
in
the
history
of
modern
england

the
other


in
the
history
of
the
united
states

which
directly
illuminate
the


history
of
france
since
the
overthrow
of
the
ancient
french
monarchy
in









one
of
these
is
the
period
of
the
long
parliament
in
england

the
other


is
the
brief
but
most
important
interval
which
elapsed
between
the


recognition
of
the
independence
of
the
thirteen
seceded
british
colonies


in
america

at
versailles
in


and
the
first
inauguration
of


washington
as
president
of
the
united
states
at
new
york
on
april






no
englishman
or
american

who
is
reasonably
familiar
with
the


history
of
either
of
these
periods

will
hastily
attribute
the
phenomena


of
modern
french
politics
to
something
essentially
volatile
and
unstable


in
the
character
of
the
french
people






my
own
acquaintance

such
as
it
is

with
france

for
i
should
be
sorry


to
pretend
to
a
thorough
knowledge
of
france

or
of
any
country
not
my


own

goes
back

as
i
have
intimated

to
the
early
days
of
the
second


empire

it
has
been
my
good
fortune

at
various
times

to
see
a
good


deal
of
the
social
and
political
life
of
france

and
i
long
ago
learned


that
to
talk
of
the
character
of
the
french
people
is
almost
as
slipshod


and
careless
as
to
talk
of
the
character
of
the
italian
people






the
french
people
are
not
the
outgrowth
of
a
common
stock

like
the


dutch
or
the
germans






the
people
of
provence
are
as
different
in
all
essential
particulars


from
the
people
of
brittany

the
people
of
french
flanders
from
the


people
of
gascony

the
people
of
savoy
from
the
people
of
normandy

as


are
the
people
of
kent
from
the
people
of
the
scottish
highlands

or
the


people
of
yorkshire
from
the
people
of
wales

the
french
nation
was
the


work

not
of
the
french
people

but
of
the
kings
of
france

not
less
but


even
more
truly
than
the
italian
nation

such
as
we
see
it
gradually
now


forming

is
the
work
of
the
royal
house
of
savoy






the
sudden
suppression
of
the
national
executive
by
a
parliamentary


conspiracy
at
paris
in

violently
interrupted
the
orderly
and


natural
making
of
france

just
as
the
sudden
suppression
of
the
national


executive
in

after
the
occupation
of
edinburgh
by

of
knavish

of

it
took
england
a
century


to
recover
her
equilibrium

between
naseby
field

england
had

except
during
the

of
charles
ii


no


better
assurance
of
continuous
domestic
peace
than
france
enjoyed
first


under
louis
philippe
and
then
under
the
second
empire

during
those


hundred
years
englishmen
were
thought
by
the
rest
of
europe
to
be
as


excitable

as
volatile

and
as
unstable
as
frenchmen
are
not
uncommonly


thought
by
the
rest
of
mankind
now

be

there
is
a
curious
old
dutch


print
of
these
days
in
which
england
appears
as
a
son
of
adam
in
the


hereditary
costume

standing
at
gaze
amid
a
great
disorder
of
garments


strewn
upon
the
floor

while
a
scroll
displayed
above
him
bears
this


legend








i
am
an
englishman

and
naked
i
stand
here





musing
in
my
mind
what
garment
i
shall
wear





now
i
will
wear
this

and
now
i
will
wear
that





and
now
i
will
wear

i
don
t
know
what






there
was
as
much

and
as
little

reason
thus
to
depict
the
england
of


the
seventeenth

as
there
is
thus
to
depict
the
france
of
the
nineteenth


century






if
there
had
ever
been

a
hundred
years
ago

such
a
thing
as
a
french


republic

founded

as
the
american
republic
of

was
founded

by
the


deliberate
will
of
the
people

and
offering
them
a
reasonable
prospect


of
maintaining
liberty
and
law

that
republic
would
exist
to
day

that


we
are
watching
the
desperate
effort
of
a
centralised
parliamentary


despotism
at
paris
in
the
year

to
maintain
a

third
republic

is


conclusive
proof
that
this
was
not
the
case






france

the
french
people

that
is



had
no
more
to
do
with
the


overthrow
of
the
monarchy
of
louis
xvi


with
the
fall
of
the
monarchy


of
charles
x


with
the
collapse
of
the
monarchy
of
july

or
with
the


abolition
of
the
second
empire

than
with
the
abdication
of
napoleon
i



at
fontainebleau






not
one
of
these
catastrophes
was
provoked
by
france
or
the
french


people

not
one
of
them
was
ever
submitted
by
its
authors
to
the
french


people
for
approval






only
two
french
governments
during
the
past
century
can
be
accurately


said
to
have
been
definitely
branded
and
condemned
as
failures
by
the


deliberate
voice
of
the
french
people

one
of
these
was
the
first


republic

which
after
going
through
a
series
of
convulsions
equally


grotesque
and
ghastly

was
swept
into
oblivion
by
an
overwhelming
vote


of
the
french
people
in
response
to
the
appeal
of
the
first
napoleon



the
other
was
the
second
republic

which
was
put
upon
trial
by
the
third


napoleon
on
december




and
condemned
to
immediate
extinction
by


a
vote
of



to



i
am
at
a
loss
to
see
how
it
is
possible


to
deduce
from
these
simple
facts
of
french
history
the
conclusion
that


the
french
people
are

and
for
a
century
have
been

madly
bent
upon


getting
a
republic
established
in
france

unless

indeed

i
am
to


suppose
that
the
french
republicans
proceed
upon
the
principle
said
to


be
justified
by
the
experience
of
countries
in
which
the
standard
of


mercantile
morality
is
not
absolutely
puritanical

that
three
successive


bankruptcies
will
enable
a
really
clever
man
to
retire
from
business


with
a
handsome
fortune






if
it
were
possible

as
happily
it
is
impossible

that
the
american


people
could
be
afflicted
with
a
single
year
of
such
a
republic
as
that


which
now
exists
in
france

we
would
rid
ourselves
of
it

if
necessary



by
seeking
annexation
to
canada
under
the
crown
of
our
common
ancestors



or
by
inviting
the
exiled
dom
pedro
to
recross
the
atlantic
and
accept


the
throne
of
a
north
american
empire

with
substantial
guarantees
that


if
we
should
ever
change
our
minds
and
put
him
politely
on
board
a
ship


again
for
europe

the
cheque
given
to
him
on
his
departure
would
not
be


dishonoured
on
presentation
to
the
national
bankers






it
is
the
penalty

i
suppose

of
our
position
in
the
united
states

as


the
first
and

so
far

the
only
successful
great
republic
of
modern


times

that
we
are
expected
to
accept
a
sort
of
moral
responsibility
for


all
the
experiments
in
republicanism

no
matter
how
absurd

odious

or


preposterous
they
may
be

which
it
may
come
into
the
heads
of
people


anywhere
else
in
the
world
to
try

i
do
not
see
why
americans
who
are


not
under
some
strenuous
necessity
of
making
stump
speeches
in
or
out
of


congress

with
an
eye
to
some
impending
election

should
submit
to
this


without
a
protest

imitation
may
be
the
sincerest
form
of
flattery

it


does
not
follow
that
it
is
the
most
agreeable






i
do
not
know
that
western
drawing
rooms
take
more
delight
in
the


japanese

who
most
amiably
present
themselves
everywhere
in
the


regulation
dress
coat
and
white
cravat
of
modern
christendom

than
in


the
chinese

who
calmly
and
haughtily
persist
in
wearing
the
ample



stately

and
comfortable
garments
of
their
own
people






the
framers
of
the
french
republican
constitution
of

did
the
united


states
the
honour
to
copy
incorrectly

and
absolutely
to
misapply



certain
leading
features
of
our
organic
law

in
order
to
accomplish


purposes
absolutely
inconsistent
with
all
american
ideas
of
liberty
and


of
justice

the
parliamentary
revolutionists
who
got
possession
of
power


in
france
in

have
so
twisted
to
their
own
ends
this
french


constitution
of


that
their
government
of
the
third
french
republic


in

really
resembles
the
government
of
the
akhoond
of
swat
about
as


nearly
as
it
resembles
the
government
of
the
american
republic
under


washington






the
parliamentary
revolutionists
of
the
third
french
republic
are


republicans
first
and
then
frenchmen

the
framers
of
the
american


republic
were
americans
first
and
then
republicans

the
republic
which


they
framed
was
an
experiment
imposed
upon
the
american
people

not
by


philosophers
and
fanatics

but
by
the
force
of
circumstances

the
ablest


of
the
men
who
framed
it
were
not
republicans
by
theory

on
the


contrary

they
had
been
born
and
bred
under
a
monarchy

under
that


monarchy
they
had
enjoyed
a
measure
of
civil
and
religious
liberty
which


the
third
republic
certainly
refuses
to
frenchmen
in
france
to
day

m



jules
ferry
and
m

constans
have
no
lessons
to
give
in
law
or
in
liberty


to
which
george
washington

or
john
adams

or
even
thomas
jefferson



would
have
listened
with
toleration
while
the
crown
still
adorned
the


legislative
halls
of
the
british
colonies
in
america

our
difficulties


with
the
mother
country
began

not
with
the
prerogative
of
the


crown

that
gave
our
fathers
so
little
trouble
that
one
of
the
original


thirteen
states
lived
and
prospered
under
a
royal
charter
from
charles


ii

down
to
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century

but
with
the


encroachments
of
the
parliament

the
roots
of
the
affection
which
binds


americans
to
the
american
republic
strike
deep
down
into
the
history
of


american
freedom
under
the
british
monarchy

the
forms
have
changed

the


living
substance
is
the
same

americans
know
at
least
as
well
as


englishmen
what
the
most
intelligent
of
french
republicans
apparently


have
still
to
learn

that
liberty
is
impossible
without
loyalty
to


something
higher
than
self
interest
and
self
will






this
sufficiently
explains
to
me
a
remark
often
cited
as
made
to
sir


theodore
martin
by
general
grant
during
the
ex
president
s
visit
to


england

to
the
effect
that
englishmen

live
under
institutions
which


americans
would
give
their
ears
to
possess







general
grant
neither
was

nor
did
he
pretend
to
be

a
great
statesman



but
he
was
an
american
of
the
americans

four
years
of
civil
war
and


eight
years
of
presidential
power
had
not
been
thrown
away
upon
him

he


came
into
the
presidency
as
the
successor
of
andrew
johnson

who
was


made
president
by
the
bullet
of
an
assassin

and
who
was
impeached

as
i


have
said

before
the
senate
for
doing
his
plain
constitutional
duty

by


an
unscrupulous
parliamentary
cabal






he
left
the
presidency

to
be
succeeded
in
it
by
a
president
who
derived


the
more
than
doubtful
title
under
which
he
took
his
seat
from
a


commission
unknown
to
the
constitution

and
accepted
by
the
american


people
only
as
the
alternative
of
political
chaos
and
of
a
fresh
civil


war






through
his
position
at
the
head
of
the
american
army

general
grant

as


i
have
already
mentioned

had
been
drawn
into
the
contest
between


president
johnson
and
the
parliamentary
cabal
bent
on
breaking
down
the


constitutional
authority
of
the
executive






going
into
the
presidency
fresh
from
this
drama

in


general
grant


went
out
of
the
presidency
in


after
a
drama
not
less
impressive


and
instructive
had
been
enacted
under
his
eyes

which
threatened
for


many
weeks
to
result
in
a
complete
failure
of
the
machinery
provided
by


the
american
constitution
for
the
lawful
and
orderly
transmission
of
the


executive
authority

it
did

in
fact

result
in
the
adoption
by
congress


of
an
extra
constitutional
expedient

by
which
the
orderly
transmission


of
the
executive
authority
was
secured

but
the
lawful
transmission
of


it

as
i
believe

and
as
i
think
i
have
reason
to
know
general
grant


believed

was
defeated






whether
the
constitutional
machinery
would
or
would
not
have
carried
us


safely
through
if
the
final
strain
had
been
put
upon
it

is
now
an


academic
question
not
here
to
be
discussed

but
the
final
strain
was


evaded
by
the
adoption
of
the
extra
constitutional
expedient
to
which
i


refer

an
electoral
commission
was
created
by
congress
to
decide
by


which
of
two
sets
of
presidential
electors
claiming
to
have
been
chosen


for
that
purpose
the
presidential
vote
of
certain
states
should
be
cast



and
it
is
a
curious
circumstance
that
general
grant

who
had
seen
his


executive
predecessor
saved
from
removal
by
a
single
vote
in
the
senate


in


saw
his
executive
successor
established
in
the
white
house

in




by
a
single
vote
in
this
electoral
commission






it
would
have
been
strange
indeed
had
the
experience
of
general
grant


failed
to
impress
upon
him

with
at
least
equal
force

the
advantages
to


liberty
of
a
hereditary
executive
acting
as
the
fountain
of
social


honour

and
the
disadvantages
to
liberty
of
an
elective
executive


tending
to
become
a
distributing
reservoir
of
political
patronage






i
once
had
a
curious
talk
bearing
on
this
subject
with
general
grant


after
he
had
retired
from
the
presidency

he
had
dined
with
me
to
meet


and
discuss
a
matter
of
some
importance
with
a
mexican
friend
of
mine



senor
romero

long
minister
of
finance
in
mexico

and
now
mexican
envoy


at
washington

when
i
next
met
the
ex
president
he
reverted
with
great


interest
to
something
which
had
been
incidentally
said
at
this
dinner


about
the
experiment
of
empire
made
in
mexico
by
iturbide

the
general


who
finally
broke
the
power
of
spain
in
that
viceroyalty

and
secured


its
independence

i
showed
him
certain
documents
which
i
had
obtained
in


mexico
through
the
kindness
of
maximilian
s
very
able
foreign
minister



senor
ramirez

a
most
accomplished
bibliophile

bearing
upon
iturbide
s


plan
for
making
the
american
mediterranean
a
mexican
lake

he
expected


to
break
up
the
united
states
by
asserting
the
right
of
the
mexican


empire
to
the
mouths
of
the
mississippi

and
the
whole
spanish
dominion


as
far
as
the
capes
of
florida


it
seems
a
mad
thing
now


said
the


ex
president


but
it
was
not
so
mad
perhaps
then


and
we
went
on
to


discuss
the
schemes
of
burr
and
wilkinson
and
the
alleged
treason
of
an


early
tennessean
senator


perhaps
it
was
not
a
bad
thing
for
us


he


said


that
the
mexicans
shot
their
first
emperor

but
was
it
a
good


thing
for
them



i
have
sometimes
wondered


he
added


what
would
have


happened
to
us
if
gates

or

what
was
at
one
time

as
you
know

quite
on


the
cards

benedict
arnold

instead
of
george
washington

had
commanded


the
armies
of
the
colonies
successfully
down
to
the
end
at
yorktown







what
indeed

that
is
a
pregnant
query

not
hastily
to
be
dealt
with
by


genial
after
dinner
oratory
about
the
self
governing
capacity
of
the


anglo
norman
race

still
less
by
fourth
of
july
declamations
over
what


the
leader
of
the
massachusetts
bar
used
to
call
the

glittering


generalities

of
the
american
declaration
of
independence






the
experience
of
the
latin
states
of
the
new
world
throws
useful


side
lights
upon
it

of
all
these
states
between
the
rio
grande
and
cape


horn

only
one
began
and
has
lived
out
its
round
half
century
of


independence
without
serious
civil
convulsions

this
is

or
rather


was

the
empire
of
brazil

of
which
dom
pedro
i


of
the
portuguese


reigning
house
of
braganza

on
march




swore
to
maintain
the


integrity
and
indivisibility

and
to
observe

and
cause
to
be
observed



the
political
constitution

that
oath
the
emperor
and
his
son
and


successor

dom
pedro
ii


who
took
it
after
him
in
due
course

seem
to


have
conscientiously
kept

it
does
not
appear
to
have
impressed
itself


as
deeply
upon
the
consciences
of
the
military
and
naval
officers
of
the


present
day
in
brazil

all
of
whom

of
course

must
have
taken
it


substantially
on
receiving
their
commission
from
the
chief
of
the
state



and
it
now
remains
to
be
seen
what
will
become
hereafter
of
the
empire






the
authors
of
the
brazilian
constitution
fully
recognised
the


impossibility
of
maintaining
a
constitutional
government
without
some


guarantee
of
the
independence
of
the
executive

they
found
this


guarantee
not
by
applying
checks
and
balances
to
the
elective


principle

but
simply
in
the
hereditary
principle

just
as
they
found


the
guarantee
of
the
independence
of
the
judiciary
in
the
life
tenure
of


the
magistrates

and
they
introduced
into
their
constitution
what
they


called
a

moderating
power


this
power
was
lodged

by
the
th
article


of
the
brazilian
constitution

with
the
emperor

and
the
article
thus


runs


the
moderating
power
is
the
key
of
the
whole
political


organisation

and
it
is
delegated
exclusively
to
the
emperor

as
the


supreme
chief
of
the
nation
and
its
first
representative

that
he
may


incessantly
watch
over
the
maintenance
of
the
independence

equilibrium



and
harmony
of
the
other
political
powers







the
key
of
the

political
organisation

of
brazil
seems
to
have
worked


very
well
for
fifty
years

now
that
it
has
been
thrown
away

it
will
be


interesting
to
watch
the
results






the
question

with
us
in
the
united
states

from
the
beginning
has
been


whether
the
carefully
devised
provisions
of
oar
organic
constitution
of



would
or
would
not
be
found
in
practice
to
protect
the
sentiment
of


loyalty
to
a
national
union
as
effectually
against
popular
caprice
and


political
intrigues
as
the
sentiment
of
loyalty
to
a
national
crown
has


been
protected
in
england
by
the
hereditary
principle

the
american


revolution
of


and
the
foundation
of
the
american
republic
of




can
never
be
understood
without
a
thorough
appreciation
of
the
fact
that


the
issues
involved
in
the
english
revolution
which
placed
the
daughter


of
james
ii

on
the
english
throne

and
in
the
establishment


subsequently
of
the
house
of
hanover

because
it
was
an
offshoot
of
the


dethroned
house
of
stuart

were
quite
as
intelligently
discussed

and


quite
as
thoroughly
worked
out

among
the
english
in
america
as
among


the
english
in
england

without
a
thorough
appreciation
of
this
fact
it


is
impossible
to
understand
the
conservative
value
to
liberty
in
the


united
states

of
the
personal
position
and
the
personal
influence
of


the
first
american
president

washington
was

in
truth

the
uncrowned


king
of
the
new
nation


first
in
war

first
in
peace

first
in
the


hearts
of
his
countrymen


what
more
and
what
less
than
this
is
there
in


the
history
of
alfred
the
great






washington
founded
no
dynasty

but
he
made
the
american
presidency


possible

and
the
american
president
is
a
king
with
a
veto

elected

not


by
the
people
directly

but
by
special
electors

for
four
years

and


re
eligible

we
celebrate
the
birthday
of
washington
like
the
birthday


of
a
king

the
same
instinct
gave
his
name
to
the
capital
of
his
nation



and
that
name
was
found
a
name
to
conjure
with
when
the
great
stress


came
of
the
civil
war
in


the
sentiment
of
loyalty

developed
and


twined
about
that
name
and
about
the
union
which
washington
had
founded



was
not
only
the
glow
at
the
core
of
the
northern
resistance
to


secession

it
was
the
secret
and
the
explanation
of
that
sudden
revival


of
the
spirit
of
national
loyalty
at
the
south
after
the
war
was
over


and
an
end
was
put
to
the
villanies
of

reconstruction


by
which


european
observers
of
american
affairs
have
been
and
still
are
so
much


puzzled

for
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
father
of
his
country
was
a


son
of
the
south

and
that
his
native
state

virginia

is
the
oldest
of


the
american
commonwealths

and
is
known
as

the
mother
of
presidents




the
historic
union
is
as
much
southern
as
northern

its
existence
was


put
in
peril
in

by
the
states
of
the
extreme
north

its
integrity


was
shattered
for
a
time
in

by
the
states
of
the
south

before
it


was
founded

in


there
was
no
such
thing
as
an
american
nation



there
were
thirteen
independent
american
states
which
for
certain


purposes
only
had
formed
what
was
described
as
a

perpetual
union




under
certain
articles
of
confederation

these
articles
were
drawn
up
in




at
a
time
when
the
event
of
the
war
with
the
mother
country
was


still
most
uncertain

and
they
were
never
finally
ratified
by
all
the


states
until


two
years
before
the
peace
of
versailles

under
these


articles
the
national
affairs
of
the
confederacy
were
controlled
by
the


congress
of
the
states

no
national
executive
existed

not
even
such
a


nominal
executive
as
now
exists
in
france

national
affairs
were
managed


during
the
recess
of
the
congress
by
a
committee

and
this
committee


could
only
confide
the
presidency
to
any
one
member
of
the
committee
for


one
year
at
a
time
out
of
three
years

this
was
even
worse
than
the


elective
kingship
without
a
veto
of
the
english
republicans
of


but


how
were
the
people
of
these
thirteen
independent
states

each
with
a


history

with
interests

with
prejudices

with
sympathies
of
its
own

to


be
brought
together
and
induced
to
form

through
a
more
perfect
union

a


nation

in
the
only
way
in
which
a
nation
can
be
formed

by
the


establishment
of
an
independent
national
executive






this
was
the
question
which
was
met
and
answered
only
after
long


debates

and
with
infinite
difficulty

by
the
american
constitutional


convention
of


it
is
more
than
probable
that
this
convention
could


never
have
been
held
without
the
influence
and
the
presence
of
george


washington

who
presided
over
its
deliberations

and
it
is
as
certain
as


anything
human
can
be

that
the
constitution
which
it
framed
would
never


have
been
accepted
by
the
people
of
the
states
if
they
had
not
known


that
the
executive
office
created
by
it
would
be
filled
by
him






the
political
safeguards
put
about
the
american
executive
by
the


constitution
may
or
may
not
always
resist
such
a
strain
as
has
already


more
than
once
been
put
upon
them

the
seceding
states

in
their


constitution
adopted
at
montgomery
in


tried
to
strengthen
these


safeguards
by
extending
the
presidential
term
to
six
years

and
making


the
president
re
eligible
only
after
an
interval
of
six
years
more

but


all
our
national
experience
goes
to
show
that
the
more
difficult
it
is


for
a
mere
majority
of
the
people
to
make
or
unmake
the
authority
which


sets
a
final
sanction
upon
the
execution
of
the
laws

the
greater
will


be
the
safety
of
the
public
liberty
and
of
private
rights






so
true
is
this
that
every
american
who
witnessed

at
london
in




the
jubilee
of
the
queen

felt

and
was
glad
to
feel

with
a
natural
and


instinctive
sympathy

the
honest
contagion
of
that
magnificent
outburst


of
the
loyalty
of
a
great
and
free
people
to
the
hereditary


representative
of
their
historic
liberties
and
of
their
historic
law

i


am
sure
that
no
intelligent
englishman
can
have
witnessed
the


tremendous
outpouring
of
the
american
people
into
new
york
on
april






to
do
honour
there
to
the
hundredth
anniversary
of
the
first


inauguration
of
george
washington

without
a
kindred
emotion






to
compare
with
the
significance
of
either
of
these
scenes
that
of
the


gigantic
cosmopolitan
fair
dedicated
at
paris
in

by
president


carnot
to
the

principles
of


is
to
exhaust
the
resources
of
the


ridiculous









iv





the
antagonism
which
now
exists
between
france
and
the
third
republic


certainly
did
not
exist
between
france
and
the
ancient
monarchy

the


members
of
the
etats
generaux
of


who
were
so
soon
permitted

by


the
incapacity
of
louis
xvi


to
resolve
that
body
into
the
chaotic
mob


which
assumed
the
name
of
a
national
assembly

were
elected

not
at
all


to
change
the
fabric
of
the
french
government

but
simply
to
reform

in


concert
with
the
king

abuses

two
thirds
of
which
were
virtually


defunct
when
the
king
took
off
his
hat
to
the
three
orders
at
versailles


on
the
th
of
may



and
the
rest
of
which
took
a
new
lease
of
life



often
under
new
names

from
the
follies
and
the
crimes
of
the
first


republic

after
the
nd
of
september



two
contemporary
observers



watching
the
drama
from
very
different
points
of
view

arthur
young
and


gouverneur
morris

long
ago
discerned
this

m

henri
taine

and
the


group
of
conscientious
historical
students
who

during
the
last
quarter


of
a
century

have
been
reconstructing
the
annals
of
the
revolutionary


period

have
put
it
beyond
all
doubt

the
enormous
majority
of
the


french
people

and
even
of
the
people
of
paris

were
so
little


infatuated
with
the

principles
of


that
they
regarded
the
advent


to
power
of
the
first
napoleon
with
inexpressible
relief

as
making
an


end
of
what
arthur
young
calls

and
not
too
sternly

a
series
of


constitutions

formed
by
conventions
of
rabble
and
sanctioned
by
the



sans
culottes

of
the
kennel


without
fully
understanding
this

it
is


impossible
to
understand
either
the
history
of
the
napoleons

or
the


present
antagonism
between
france
and
the
third
republic






of
this
i
am
so
deeply
convinced
that
i
have
thought
it
right
to


interweave

when
occasion
offered

with
my
account
of
things
as
they
are


in
france

what
i
believe
to
be
the
historic
truth
as
to
things
as
they


were
in
france
at
and
before
the
period
of
the
revolution

to
judge
the


france
of

fairly

and
forecast
its
future
intelligently

we
must


thoroughly
rid
ourselves
of
the
notion
that
the
masses
of
the
french


people
had
anything
more
to
do
with
the
dethronement
and
the
murder
of


louis
xvi

than
the
masses
of
the
english
people
had
to
do
with
the


dethronement
and
the
murder
of
charles
i

neither
crime
was
perpetrated


to
enlarge
the
liberties
or
to
protect
the
interests
of
the
people

we


long
ago
got
at
the
truth
about
the
great
english
rebellion


pride
s


purge


the

elective
kingship
without
a
veto
of
the

new
model


and


the
merciless
mystification
of
bradshaw

tell
their
own
story

steering


to
avoid
the
scylla
of
strafford

the
luckless
parliamentarians
ran
the


ship
of
state
full
into
the
charybdis
of
cromwell






it
is
only
within
very
recent
times
that
the
daylight
of
facts
has
begun


to
dissipate
the
mists
of
the
french
legend
of


even
republican


writers
of
repute
now
disdain
to
concern
themselves
more
seriously
with


the
so
called
histories
of
thiers

of
mignet

and
of
lamartine
than
with


the

chevalier
de
maison
rouge

of
alexandre
dumas
and
the

charlotte


corday

of
m

ponsard






of
course
the
legend
dies
hard

all
legends
do

even
the
whipping
of


titus
oates
at
the
cart
s
tail
through
london
did
not
kill
the
legend
of


sir
edmondsbury
godfrey
and
the
popish
plot

the
republicans
of
the


third
republic
have
not
scrupled
to
set
up
a
statue
to
danton

people


who
might
easily
learn
the
truth
still
speak

and
not
in
france
only



about
robespierre
and
madame
roland
in
terms
which
really
justify
m



bire
in
anticipating
a
time
when
raoul
rigault
maybe
celebrated
as
a


patriot
and
louise
michel
as
a
heroine

no
longer
ago
than
in



certain
people

perhaps
relying
on
the
fact
that
m

casimir
perier

the


actual
owner
of
the
chateau
at
vizille
in
which
the
famous
meeting
of


the
estates
of
dauphiny
was
held
in


is
a
republican

actually


undertook
to

ring
up
the
curtain

on
the
centennial
of

by


representing
barnave
and
mounier
as
clamouring
in

for
a
republic
at


vizille

of
all
which
let
us
say
with
mr

carlyle


what
should


falsehood
do
but
decease

being
ripe

decompose
itself

and
return
to


the
father
of
it


to
whom

alas

i
fear

under
this
inexorable
law
must


in
due
time
revert
too
many
of
the
fuliginous
word
pictures
of
mr



carlyle
s
own
dithyrambic
prose
concerning
the

french
revolution







the
giants
who
stalked
through
his
inflamed
imagination
like
spectres
on


the
brocken

may
be
seen
to
day
in
the
musee
de
la
revolution
at
paris



shrunken
to
their
true
proportions

a
dreary
procession

indeed

of


dreamers

madmen

quacks
and
felons

how
can
that
be
called
a

great


revolution


of
which
it
is
recorded
that
before
it
had
filled
the
brief


orbit
of
a
decade

it
had
made
an
end
of
the
life
or
of
the
reputation


of
every
single
man
conspicuous
in
initiating
or
promoting
it

the
men


who
began
the
english
revolution
of

organised
the
new
order
to


which
it
led

the
men
who
began
the
american
revolution
of



organised
the
new
nation
which
it
called
into
being

this
must
have
been


as
true
of
the
french
revolution
had
it
been
really
an
outcome
of
the



principles
of



or
of
any
principles
at
all

but
it
was
nothing
of


the
kind

it
was
simply
a
carnival
of
incapacities

ending
naturally
in


an
orgie
of
crime

it
was
in
the
order
of
nature
that
it
should
deify


mirabeau
in
the
pantheon

only
to
dig
up
his
dishonoured
remains
and


trundle
them
under
an
unmarked
stone
at
the
meeting
of
four
streets



that
it
should
set
bailly
on
a
civic
throne

only
to
drag
him
forth



under
a
freezing
sky

to
his
long
and
dismal
martyrdom
amid
a
howling


mob

that
it
should
acclaim
lafayette
as
the
saviour
of
france

only
to


hunt
him
across
the
frontier
into
an
austrian
prison






it
was
because
france
detested
the
republic

and

detesting
the


republic

might
at
any
moment
recall
the
bourbons

that
napoleon


executed
the
duc
d
enghien

it
was
to
make
an
end
of
claims
older
than


his
own
upon
the
allegiance
of
a
people
essentially
and
naturally


monarchical

it
was
a
crime

but
it
was
not
a
squalid
and
foolish
crime


like
the
murder
of
louis
xvi

it
belonged
to
the
same
category
with
the


execution
of
conradin
of
hohenstaufen
by
charles
of
anjou

not

indeed



as
to
its
mere
atrocity

but
as
to
its
motives
and
its
intent

it


announced
to
the
french
people
the
advent
of
a
new
dynasty

and
left


them
no
choice
but
between
the
republic
and
the
empire

an
autograph


letter
of
carnot

the
grandfather
of
the
actual
president
of
the
third


republic

sold
the
other
day
in
paris
may
be
cited
to
illustrate
this


point

carnot

like
many
other
regicides

would
gladly
have
made
his


peace
with
louis
xviii

his
peace
with
some
sovereign
he
knew
that
he


must
make

the
letter
i
now
refer
to
was
written
after
the
return
of
the


emperor
from
elba

and
it
could
hardly
have
been
written
had
carnot
not


believed
that
france
might
be
rallied
to
the
empire
and
to
its
chief



because
france
could
not
exist
without
a
monarchy
and
a
monarch






the
restoration
of
the
monarchy
was
cordially
accepted
by
the
french


people

the
american
friends
of
france
celebrated
it
with
a
banquet
in


new
york

france
prospered
under
it

it
laid
the
foundations
of
the


french
dominion
in
africa

and
thereby
gave
to
modern
france
the
only


field
of
colonial
expansion
which
can
be
said

down
to
the
present
time



to
have
enured
to
any
real
good
either
for
french
commerce
or
the
french


people

certainly
m

ferry
and
the
republic
have
so
far
done
nothing


with
tonquin
to
dim
the
lustre
of
the
monarchical
conquest
of
algiers






on
the
contrary

the
republic

through
its
occupation
of
tunis

its



pouting
policy

towards
england
in
egypt

and
its
more
recent


intimations
of
a
great
french
africa
to
be
carried
eastward
to
the


atlantic

has
prepared

and
is
preparing

for
france
in
the
perhaps
not


distant
future
a
new
chapter
of
political
accidents
upon
the
possible


gravity
and
extent
of
which
prudent
frenchmen
meditate
with
dubious


satisfaction






the
sceptre
passed
as
quietly
from
louis
xviii

to
charles
x

in
france


as
from
george
iv

to
william
iv

in
england

so
far

indeed

as
public


disorder
indicates
public
discontent

the
english
monarchy
was
in


greater
peril
during
the
period
between

and

than
the
french


monarchy

when
the
revolution
of
july
came

no
man
thought
seriously
of


asking
france
to
accept
a
second
trial
of
the
republic

and
the
crown


was
pressed
upon
the
duc
d
orleans

with
the
anxious
assent
of


lafayette

the
friend
of
washington

mirabeau
s

grandison
cromwell

of


the
revolution
of


under
the
long
reign
of
louis
philippe
france


again
prospered
exceedingly

french
art
and
french
literature
more
than


recovered
their
ancient
prestige

attempts
were
made
to
restore
the


elder
branch
of
the
bourbons
and
to
restore
the
dynasty
of
the


bonapartes

but
no
serious
attempt
was
made
to
restore
the
republic






the
revolution
of

took
even
paris
by
surprise

the
republic
which


emerged
from
it
filled
france
with
consternation

and
opened
the
way
at


once
for
the
restoration
of
the
empire

on
december




the
french


people
made
the
prince
president
dictator

by
a
vote
the
significance
of


which
will
be
only
inadequately
appreciated
if
we
fail
to
remember
that


the
millions
who
cast
it
were
by
no
means
sure
that

by
putting
the


sword
of
france
again
into
the
hands
of
a
napoleon

they
would
not


provoke
the
perils
of
a
great
european
war

france
did
not
court
these


perils

but
she
preferred
them
to
the
risks
of
a
republic






i
spent
many
months
in
france
at
that
time

and
to
me

remembering
what


i
then
saw
and
heard
among
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
men

not
in
the


departments
only
but
in
paris
itself

the
persistency
with
which
the


leaders
of
the
present
republican
party
have
set
themselves

ever
since


they
came
definitely
into
power
with
m

grevy
in


to
reviving
all


the
most
odious
traditions
of
the
earlier
republican
experiments

and
to


re
identifying
the
republic
with
all
that
the
respectable
masses
of
the


french
people
most
hate
and
dread

has
seemed
from
the
first

and
now


seems

little
short
of
judicial
madness






it
did
not
surprise
me

therefore

in


to
find
the
banner
of
the


monarchy
frankly
unfurled
by
m

lambert
de
ste

croix
and
scores
of


other
conservatives

as
they
then
called
themselves

at
the
legislative


elections
of
that
year

it
did
surprise
me

however

to
see
the
strength


of
the
support
which
they
instantly
received
throughout
the
country

for


i
believe
the
masses
of
the
french
people
to
be
at
heart
monarchical



less
from
any
sentiment
of
loyalty
at
all
either
to
the
race
of
their


ancient
kings
or
to
the
imperial
dynasty

than
because
the
experience
of


the
last
century

to
which

as
i
think
very
unwisely

the
republican


government
has
appealed
in
what
i
cannot
but
call
its
rigmarole
about


the

centennial
of



has
led
them
to
associate
with
the
idea
of
a


republic
the
ideas
of
instability
and
of
anarchy

and
with
the
idea
of
a


monarchy
the
ideas
of
stability
and
of
order

now
the
government
of
the


third
republic

first
under

thiers
and
then
under
the
marechal
duc
of


magenta

was
so
conducted
from

to

as
to
shake
this


association






under
it
frenchmen
had
seen
that
a
republic
might
actually
exist
in


france
for
seven
years
without
disturbing
social
order

interfering
with


freedom
of
conscience

attacking
the
religion
of
the
country

or
wasting


its
substance






there
were

wars
and
rumours
of
wars

in
the
air
in


it
was
very


loudly
whispered
that
germany

alarmed
by
the
rapid
advances
of
france


towards
a
complete
recovery
of
her
national
strength

meant
suddenly
and


savagely
to
strike
at
her

and
that

unless
the
essentially
national
and


military
government
of
the
marechal
duc
was
replaced
by
a
government


which
would
divert
the
resources
of
france
largely
into
industrial



commercial

and
colonial
adventures

a
new
invasion
might
at
any
moment


be
feared

it
ought
to
have
been
obvious
that
a
government
which
held
in


its
hand
a
balance
of



francs
was
much
less
likely
to
be


wantonly
attacked
than
a
government
which
meant
to
outrun
its
revenue



with
a
declared
balance
of



francs
to
the
good

france
might


raise
at
the
shortest
notice




francs
in
a
war
loan

the


balance
of
the
marechal
duc
s
government
was
in
fact
a
war
treasure

and


a
war
treasure
of
that
magnitude
was
a
tolerably
effectual
guarantee
of


peace

this
ought

i
say

to
have
been
obvious

but
it
is
the
triumph
of


demagogic
skill
to
prevent
a
great
people
from
seeing
as
a
mass
what
is


perfectly
plain
to
every
man
of
them
taken
alone

under
the
stress
of
a


war
panic
the
french
people

whose
dread
and
dislike
of
republics
in


general
had
been
lulled

as
i
have
shown

into
repose
by
seven
years
of


a
conservative
republican
rule

were
led
into
granting
the
untested


republic
of
gambetta
the
credit
fairly
earned
by
the
tested
republic
of


macmahon
and
of
thiers






m

grevy

thought
the
incarnation
of
thrift

of
peace
at
any
price

and


of
commercial
development

was
elected
president
in


m

leon
say

a


man
of
wealth
and
of
business

from
whom
more
circumspection
might
have


been
expected

lent
himself

as
minister
of
the
finances

in
combination


with
the
rather
visionary
m

de
freycinet

to
a
grand
scheme
devised
by


m

gambetta

in
a
single
night


like
aladdin
s
palace

for
spending


indefinite
millions
of
money
upon
docks

railways
and
ports
all
over


france

wherever
there
was
a
seat
in
the
chamber
to
be
kept
or
won

the



true
republicans


as
they
call
themselves

must
be
kept
in
power

the


republicans
who
hold
it
to
be
their
mission

no

not
their
mission

for


that
word
smacks
of
a
deity

but
their
proud
prerogative

to
rid
france


and
the
world
of
the
christian
religion

to
abolish
all
forms
of
worship


and
of
monarchy
from
off
the
face
of
the
earth

and
generally
to
fashion


the
felicity
of
mankind

in
and
out
of
france

after
their
own
mind



they
went
to
work
without
delay

having
made
the
executive

in
the


person
of
m

grevy

a
puppet

they
began
at
once

in


to
pour
out


the
money
of
the
taxpayers
like
water

for
what
we
know
in
the
united


states
as

purposes
of
political
irrigation


to

purge

the
public


service

in
all
its
branches

from
the
highest
to
the
lowest

of
all
men


not
ready
to
swear
allegiance
to
their
creed

to
create
new
posts
and
to


fill
them
with
the
dependents
and
parasites
of
the
republican
party


chiefs






the
balance
of



fr


c


to
be
exact


with
which
the


republic
of
thiers
and
macmahon
had
closed
the
year


rapidly


vanished






on
april




m

leon
say
announced
to
the
chamber
of
deputies
that


he
expected
the
country
to
spend
for

a
sum
of




francs



and
to
meet
this
expenditure
with
an
estimated
income
of






francs






in

the
expenditure
of
france
had
reached




francs

and


the
income
of
france
had
reached




fr


c

two
years
had


sufficed
to
reverse
the
situation

and
to
convert
an
excess
of
receipts


over
expenditure
under
the
government
of
the
marechal
duc

amounting
to


more
than



francs

into
an
excess
of
expenditure
over
receipts


under
his

truly
republican

successor
amounting
to



francs






from
that
moment
to
this
the
third
republic
has
been
steadily
expending


for
france
year
after
year
at
least
five
hundred
millions
of
francs

or


twenty
millions
of
pounds
sterling

more
than
it
has
been
able
to


collect
from
the
french
people
in
the
way
of
normal
revenue

the
exact


amount
of
this
monstrous
deficiency
it
is
not
easy
to
state
with


precision

so
distinguished
an
economist
as
m

leroy
beaulieu

a


republican
of
the
moderate
type

puts
it
at
the
sum
i
have
stated

of


five
hundred
millions
a
year
for
ten
years

at
the
elections
of
last


year
the
carnot
government
ordered

or
encouraged

the
prefect
of
the


herault

m

pointu
nores

to
oppose
openly
and
energetically
the


election
of
m

leroy
beaulieu
as
a
deputy
for
the
district
of
lodeve
in


that
department

why

m

leroy
beaulieu
is
one
of
the
few
really
able


and
distinguished
frenchmen

known
beyond
the
limits
of
france

who
may


be
regarded
as
sincere
believers
in
the
possibility
of
founding
a


substantial
and
orderly
french
republic

but
m

leroy
beaulieu

when
he


sees
a
deficiency
in
the
public
accounts

calls
it
a
deficiency

and


lifts
up
his
voice
in
warning
against
a
policy
which
accepts
an
annual


deficiency
of
five
hundred
millions
of
francs
as
natural

normal

and
to


be
expected
in
the
administration
of
a
great
republic






therefore

the
presence
of
m

leroy
beaulieu
in
the
chamber
of
deputies


is
a
thing
to
be
prevented
at
any
price

the

republicans

of
the


herault
this
year
tried
to
prevent
it
not
only
by
treating

informal



ballots
thrown
for
him
as
invalid

and
accepting

informal

ballots


thrown
against
him
as
valid

but

as
the
report
of
a
committee
of
the


chamber
admits

by

irregularities

which
in
other
countries
would
be


described
in
harsher
terms






yet
the
majority
of
the
new
chamber
has
postponed
action
upon
this


report
of
its
own
committee
till
after
the
recess

and
m

leroy
beaulieu


is
not
yet
allowed
to
occupy
the
seat
which
the
voters
of
lodeve


undoubtedly
chose
him
to
fill






if
we
accept
m

leroy
beaulieu
s
estimate
of
the
average
annual


deficiency
in
the
french
budget
as
correct

it
is
clear
that
the

true


republicans

have
mulcted
france
since

in
the
round
sum
of
five


milliards
of
francs

or

in
other
words

of
a
second
german
war


indemnity






but
a
banker
of
eminence

thoroughly
familiar
with
the
french
finances



tells
me
that
m

leroy
beaulieu
has
underestimated
the
amount

he
puts


it
himself
at
an
annual
average
for
the
past
decade
of





francs

thanks
to
the
device
adopted

i
am
sorry
to
say

by
m

leon
say



in


of
transferring
to
what
is
called
the

extraordinary
budget

of


each
year
numerous
items
which
should
properly
find
a
place
in
the



ordinary
budget

of
each
year

it
is
not
very
easy
to
get
at
a
precise


and
definite
basis
for
estimating
the
real
amount
of
these
annual


deficiencies






m

amagat

a
republican
deputy
for
the
department
of
the
cantal

who
has


distinguished
himself
and
earned
the
hostility
of
the
carnot
government


by
his
cool
and
methodical
treatment
of
these
financial
matters



denounces
this
device
as

deplorable


and
as
keeping
alive
the
most


strange

illusions

among
well
meaning
french
republicans
about
the
real


condition
of
the
national
finances






precisely

but
the
device
was
adopted
expressly
to
keep
alive
these



illusions


in
order
that
the

illusions

might
keep
alive
the


politicians
who
adopted
the
device






it
served
m

leon
say

who
knew
better

in


it
serves
m

rouvier



who

perhaps

does
not
know
better

in


the
new
chamber
met
on


november




a
fortnight
had
hardly
passed
when
m

rouvier

as


minister
of
the
finances

the

minister
of
ill
omen

as
m

amagat
calls


him

rose
in
his
place
and

without
a
blush

affirmed
that
the
budget


for

showed
an
excess
of
receipts
over
expenditure
of

forty


millions
of
francs


this
bold
statement
was
promptly
telegraphed
from


paris

by
the
correspondents
of
the
foreign
press
in
that
city

to
the


four
corners
of
the
globe

what
did
it
mean

it
meant
simply
this

that



thanks
to
the
financial
success
of
the
government
investment
of
the


public
money
in
a
grand
raree
show
at
paris

called
a

universal


exposition


such
an
excess
of
income
over
outlay
appeared
in
what
is


called
the

ordinary
budget


as
to
the

extraordinary

budget

oh

that


is
quite
another
matter






it
is
as
if
an
english
householder
should
divide
his
yearly
accounts


into

ordinary

and

extraordinary

accounts

putting
under
the



ordinary

accounts
his
cab
and
railway
fares

his
club
expenses

his


transactions
on
the
turf

and
his
ventures
at
monte
carlo

but
remitting


to
the

extraordinary

accounts
such
unconsidered
trifles
as
house
rent



domestic
expenses

the
bills
of
tailors
and
milliners

and
taxes

local


and
imperial

for


for
example

m

leon
say

as
finance
minister



gave
in
his

ordinary

budget
at




francs

which
showed
a


reduction
of



francs
from
the

ordinary

budget
of


but


with
this
cheerful
statement
m

leon
say
gave
in
also
his



extraordinary

budget
at



francs

the
whole
of
which
rather


important
sum
was
to
be
raised

not
out
of
the
revenue

but
by
a
loan






this
system
has
been
carried
on
ever
since


when
the

true


republicans

got
possession
of
the
legislature

two
years
before
they


put
m

grevy
into
the
elysee
as
president






on
july




m

daynaud

an
authority
on
questions
of
finance



summed
up
the
results
in
a
speech
delivered
in
the
chamber
of
deputies



the
government
in

spent

in
round
numbers





francs

in



it
spent




francs

all
this
without
including
what
are


called

supplementary
credits


so
that

putting
these
aside

it
appears


from
the
speech
of
m

daynaud
that

in
seven
years

between

and




the

true
republicans

subjected
the
people
of
france
to
an


increase
of
no
less
than



francs
in
their
annual
public


expenditure






meanwhile
these
same

true
republicans


who
were
thus
adding
hundreds


of
millions
yearly
to
the
public
debt

struck
hundreds
of
thousands
out


of
the
lawful
income
of
the
clergy
of
france

they
ordered
the


dispersion
by
executive
decrees

and

if
necessary
by
military
force




of
all
religious
orders
and
communities
not

authorised

by
the


government

they
drove
nuns
and
sisters
of
charity

with
violence
and


insult

out
of
their
abodes

they
expelled
the
religious
nurses
from
the


hospitals
and
the
priests
from
the
prisons
and
the
almshouses

they



laicised

the
schools
of
france

throwing
every
symbol
of
religion

in


many
cases
literally

into
the
street

forbidding

literally

the
name


of
god
to
be
mentioned
within
the
walls
of
a
school

and
striking
out


every
allusion
to
the
christian
faith
from
the
text
books
supplied
at


the
cost
of
the
christian
parents
of
france
to
their
children
in
the


schools
supported
out
of
taxes
paid
by
themselves






it
is
simply
impossible
to
overstate
the
virulence
and
the
violence
of


this
official
republican
war
against
religion
which
began
under
the


waddington
ministry
almost
as
soon
as
it
took
possession
of
the


government
in


it
was
formally
opened
under
the
leadership
of
m



ferry

m

ferry
is
admitted
to
be
the
ideal
statesman
of
the
opportunist


republicans
now
in
power

to
him
m

carnot
owes
his
presidency
of
the


republic

in
march

m

jules
ferry
asked
the
republican
majority
of


the
house
to
pass
a
law
concerning
the

higher
education


in
the
draft


of
which
he
had
inserted
a
clause
ever
since
famous
as

article





depriving
any
frenchman
who
might
be
a
member
of
any
religious


corporation

not
recognised
by
the
state

of
the
right
to
teach

this



article


was
a
revival
of
an
amendment
offered
to
but
not
carried
by


the
legislative
assembly
of
the
second
republic
in


the
principle


of
it
is
as
old
as
the
emperor
julian

who
forbade
christians
to
teach


in
the
schools
of
the
empire






m

ferry
s
law
was
intended
to
repeal
a
previous
law
adopted
in




and
which
had
not
been
then
three
years
in
operation

by
the
law
of
july






the
republic
of
thiers
and
macmahon
had
modified

in
the


interest
of
liberty

the
monopoly
of
higher
education
in
france
enjoyed


by
the
state

it
was
an
essentially
wise

liberal

and

progressive



law

but
the
republicans
of
gambetta
could
not
endure
it

for
it
gave


the
christians
of
france
the
right
to
provide
for
the
higher
education


of
their
children
in
their
own
way

so
it
must
be
abolished






it
was
abolished

and
though
the
senate

making
a
partial
stand
for
law


and
for
the
equal
rights
of
french
citizens

struck
out

article



m



ferry
and
his
friends

who
controlled
the
president

caused
him
to
issue


an
executive
decree

to
which
i
have
already
referred

breaking
up
the


religious
orders
aimed
at
in

article



this
was
in


in

the


chamber
adopted
a
law
proposed
by
m

paul
bert

confirming
to
the
state


the
monopoly
of
secondary
education

and
to
day
we
see
m

clemenceau



the
avowed
enemy
of
m

jules
ferry
and
of
the
opportunists

shaking


hands
with
them
in
public

after
the
elections
of


on
this
one


question
of
deadly
hostility
to
all
religion
in
the
educational


establishments
of
france

at
a
banquet
given
on
december

by
certain


anti
boulangist
students
in
paris
to
the
government
deputies
for
the


seine

m

clemenceau
declared
himself
in
favour
of

the
union
of
all


republicans


upon
what
lines
and
to
what
end



to
prepare
the
grand


social
revolution
and
make
war
upon
the
theocratic
spirit
which
seeks
to


reduce
the
human
mind
to
slavery







in
other
words

the
third
republic
is
to
combine
the
socialism
of



with
the
atheism
of


the
national
workshops
with
the
worship
of


reason

and
to
join
hands

i
suppose

with
the
extemporised

republic
of


brazil

in
a
grand
propaganda
which
shall
secure
the
abolition

not


only
of
all
the
thrones
in
europe

but
of
all
the
altars
in
america

if


language
means
anything
and
facts
have
any
force

this
is
the
inevitable


programme
of
the
french
republic
of


and
this
is
the
entertainment


to
which
the
christian
nations
of
the
new
world
and
the
old
were
invited


at
paris
in
the
great

centennial

year







believing
this
to
be
the
inevitable
programme
of
the
republic

as


represented
by
the
government
of
president
grevy
so
long
ago
as


i


was
yet
surprised

as

have
said

to
see
the
strength
of
the
protest


recorded
against
it
by
the
voters
of
france
at
the
legislative
elections


in


because
the
republic
of
thiers
and
macmahon
had
made

and


deservedly

so
much
progress
in
the
confidence
of
the
french
people



that
i
had
hardly
expected
to
see
the
essentially
conservative
heart
of


france
startled

even
by
three
or
four
years

experience
of
the


government
of
m

grevy

into
an
adequate
sense
of
the
perils
into
which


these
successors
of
the
marechal
duc
were
leading
the
country







a
bird
in
the
hand
is
worth
two
in
the
bush

is
an
essentially
french


proverb

seven
years
of
peace

liberty

and
financial
prosperity
under


the
conservative
republic
should
have
gone
far

i
thought

to
convince


the
average
french
peasant
that
he
might

after
all

be
safe
under
a


republic

doubtless
this
impression
of
mine
was
not
wholly
unfounded



yet

in
spite
of
this
important
check
upon
the
headway
of
the
reaction


against
republicanism
provoked
by
the
fanaticism
and
the
financial


extravagance
of
the
government
of
president
grevy

and
in
spite

too

of


the
open
official
pressure
put
upon
the
voters
of
france
by
the
then


minister
of
the
interior

m

allain
targe

who
issued
a
circular


commanding
all
the
prefects
in
france
to
stand

neutral

between


republican
candidates
of
all
shades

but
to
exert
themselves
for
the


defeat
of
all

reactionary

candidates

in
spite
of
all
this

the


elections
of
october
and
november

sent
up
about
two
hundred


monarchical
members

whose
seats
could
by
no
trick
or
device
be
stolen


from
them

to
the
chamber
of
deputies

and
pitted
a
popular
vote
of





declared
enemies
of
the
existing
republic
against
a
popular


vote
of



citizens
anxious
to
maintain
or
willing
to
submit
to


it






from
that
time
to
the
present
day
the
government
of
the
third
french


republic
has
been
standing
on
the
defensive

it
has
steadily
lost


ground

with
every
passing
year

in
the
confidence
and
respect
of
the


french
people

the
financial
scandals

amid
which
president
grevy
and


his
son
in
law

m

wilson

disappeared
and
president
carnot
was



invented


simply
revealed
a
condition
of
things
inherent
in
the
very


nature
of
the
political
organisation
of
france
under
the
parliamentary


revolutionists
who
came
into
power
in







the
third
french
republic

such
as
these
men
have
made
it

is
condemned



hopelessly
and
irretrievably
condemned

by
its
creed
to
be
a
government


of
persecution
and
by
its
machinery
to
be
a
government
of
corruption



there
is
no
escape
for
it









v





it
has
made
the
government
of
france

not
the
administration

but
the


form

the
constitution
of
the
government

a
party
question

and
it
has


organised
the
party
which
insists
that
france
shall
be
a
republic



openly
and
avowedly
upon
the
maxim
of
danton
that

to
the
victors
belong


the
spoils


what
has
come
of
this
maxim
in
the
united
states

where
the


form
and
constitution
of
the
republic
are
accepted
by
all
political


parties

and
the
administration
of
the
government
alone
is
a
party


question

i
need
not
say






there
are

black
points

even
on
the
horizon
of
the
american
republic



as
all
americans
know

but
there
is
no
point
blacker
than
this

as
to


which

however

it
is
possible
with
us
that
good
men
of
all
political


parties
may
act
together
in
the
future
as
they
have
acted
together
in


the
past
for
civil
service
reform

but
what
is
possible
with
us
is
not


possible
with
the
party
of
the
republic
in
france

for

by
making
the


republic
a
republic
of
religious
persecution

the
republicans
of
the


republic
of
gambetta

jules
ferry

carnot

and
clemenceau
have
made
it


necessarily
a
republic
of
political
proscription

and
political


proscription
inevitably
means
political
corruption






if
any
man
needs
to
learn
this

let
him
study
the
story
of
the


establishment
of
the
protestant
succession
in
england
by
walpole

and


the
story
of
the
overthrow
of
the
united
states
bank
by
president


jackson

in
america

he
may
think
the
protestant
succession
in
england



and
the
overthrow
of
the
united
states
bank
in
america

worth
the
price


paid
for
each

but
he
will
learn
at
least
what
the
price
was






it
will
not
be
the
fault
of
the
carnot
government

certainly
not
of
the


most
energetic
member
of
that
government

m

constans

minister
of
the


interior

if
the
french
people
fail
to
learn
this






a
very
much
higher
price
will
have
to
be
paid
for
the
extirpation
of


religion
out
of
france

and
the
education
of
the
french
people
into
what


m

jules
ferry
fantastically
supposes
to
be

herbert
spencer
s

gospel



identifying
duty
with
self
indulgence






the
late
chamber

doubtless
having
the
then
impending
elections
in
view



voted
to
abolish
the
secret
service
fund
of
the
ministry
of
the


interior

it
was
a
platonic
vote

referring
only
to
the
budget
of




nor
did
it
take
effect

but
on
december




m

constans

having


made
the
re
establishment
of
this
fund
a
cabinet
question

got
up
in
the


chamber
and
boldly
declared
that
he
wanted
a
secret
service
fund
of





fr


or
about


l


sterling

that
he
did
not
care
what


the
right
thought
about
such
a
fund

that
he
meant
to
use
it
to

combat


conspiracies
against
the
republic


and
that
he
expected
the
majority
to


give
it
to
him
as
a
mark
of
their
personal
confidence






that
the
war
office

in
a
country
like
france

should
need
a
secret


service
fund

is
intelligible

it
is
intelligible
that
a
secret
service


fund
should
be
legitimately
required

perhaps

by
the
foreign
office
of


a
country
like
france

but
why
should
a
secret
service
fund
of
more
than




l


sterling
be
required
by
the
home
secretary
of
a
french


republic
which
is
supposed
to
be

a
government
of
the
people

by
the


people

for
the
people







i
have
an
impression

which
it
will
require
evidence
to
remove

that
no


such
secret
service
fund
as
this
is
at
the
disposal
of
the
chancellor
of


the
german
empire

and
i
find
the
whole
expense
of
the
home
office
of


the
monarchy
of
great
britain
set
down
at
less
than
half
the
amount


which

after
a
brief
debate

the
republicans
of
the
new
chamber
in


france

by
a
majority
of
a
hundred
votes

quietly
put
under
the
control


of
the
french
home
secretary

to
show
their

confidence

in
the


excellent
man
to
whose
unhesitating
manipulation

through
his
prefects



of
the
votes
cast
in
september
and
october
last

so
many
of
them
are


universally
believed
in
france
to
be
really
indebted
for
their
seats






in
the
year

the
british
budget
shows
an
outlay
on
the
home
office


of


l







more
than
this

the

secret
service
fund

voted
out
of
the
pockets
of


the
taxpayers
of
france
into
the
strong
box
of
the
minister
of
the


interior

considerably
exceeds
the
cost
of
the
british
treasury
office



in

the
british
budget
gave
the
first
lord
of
the
treasury

to
cover


the
expenses
of
that
great
and
important
department
of
the
british


monarchical
government



l



or
nearly


l


less
than
the


republicans
of
the
third
french
republic
have
generously
put
at
the


disposal
of
m

constans
to

combat
conspiracies

against
the
life
of
a


republic
of
which
in
the
same
breath
we
are
asked
to
believe
that
it
has


just
been
acclaimed
with
enthusiasm
by
the
masses
of
the
french
people



as
the
fixed

final

and
permanent
government
of
their
deliberate


choice






at
this
rate
it
will
actually
cost
the
taxpayers
of
republican
france


more
than
two
thirds
as
much
merely
to
keep
the
republic
from
being


suddenly
done
to
death
some
fine
day
between
breakfast
and
dinner

as


it
costs
the
taxpayers
of
great
britain
to
keep
up
the
state
and
dignity


of
the
british
sovereign
from
year
to
year

the
total
annual
amount

i


find

of
the
civil
list
of
great
britain
annually
voted
to
the
queen

of


the
annual
grants
to
other
members
of
the
royal
family

and
of
the


viceroyalty
of
ireland
is


l


of
this
amount
the
hereditary


revenues

surrendered
to
the
nation

cover


l


this
leaves
an


annual
charge
upon
the
taxpayers
of


l


sterling

or
only




l


more
than
the
sum
deliberately
voted
by
the
republican


chamber
at
paris
into
the
hands
of
m

constans
to
be
by
him
used
in



combating
conspiracies

against
the
republic


or

in
other
words
and


in
plain
english

in
making
things
comfortable
for
his
political


friends

and
uncomfortable
for
his
political
enemies






and
this

observe

is
a
mere
supplementary
adjunct
to
the
budget
of
this


energetic
and
admirable
minister

that
budget
having
been
fixed
by
the


late
chamber
for

at



francs

or

in
round
numbers






l


sterling

of
which
handsome
amount



francs

or




l


sterling

being
the
outlay
on
the
central
administration
and


the
prefectures

must
be
added
to
the



francs

or


l




sterling

of
the
presidential
salary
and
allowances

in
order
to
give
us


a
basis
for
a
fair
approximate
comparison
of
the
cost
to
republican


france
of
her
executive
president
and
prefects
with
the
cost
to


monarchical
great
britain
of
her
executive
sovereign

lords
lieutenant



and
viceroy
of
ireland

stated
in
round
numbers

the
result
appears
to


be
that
for
their
republican
president
and
their
eighty
three
republican


prefects

the
taxpayers
of
france
pay
annually
out
of
their
own
pockets




l


against


l


paid
annually
out
of
their
own
pockets
by


the
taxpayers
of
great
britain
for
their
monarchical
sovereign



eighty
six
lords
lieutenant

a
viceroy
of
ireland

and
thirty
two


lieutenants
of
the
irish
counties

from
the
point
of
view
of
the


taxpayers

this
would
seem
to
lend
some
colour
to
lord
beaconsfield
s


contention

that
economy
is
to
be
found
on
the
side
of
the
system
which


rewards
certain
kinds
of
public
service
by

public
distinction
conferred


by
the
fountain
of
honour







the
threadbare
witticism
about
the
bourbons
of


who
had
learned


nothing
and
forgotten
nothing

may
well
be
furbished
up
for
the
benefit


of
the
republicans
who
now
control
the
third
french
republic

however


true
it
may

or
may
not

have
been
of
the
comte
de
provence
and
the


comte
d
artois

henri
iv


who
was
certainly
a
bourbon
of
the
bourbons



had
a
quick
wit
at
learning

and
upon
occasion
also
a
neat
knack
of


forgetting

he
thought
paris
well
worth
a
mass

heard
the
mass

and
got


paris






it
was
not
necessary
for
the
republicans
of
the
third
republic

after


the
formidable
lesson
which
france
read
them
at
the
elections
in




to
hear
mass
themselves

they
were
perfectly
free
to
persist
and
to


perish
in
their
unbelief

and

like
the
hero
of
sir
alfred
lyall
s

land


of
regrets










get
damned
in
their
commonplace
way







all
that
christian
france
asked
of
them
in

was
that
they
would


leave
their
fellow
citizens
as
free
to
hear
mass
as
they
themselves


were
free
not
to
hear
it

they
had
only
to
let
the
religion
of
the


french
people
alone

to
respect
the
consciences
and
the
civil
liberty
of


their
countrymen

and
the
tides
that
were
rising
against
them

and
the


republic
because
of
them

must
inevitably
have
begun
to
subside






the
hostility
between
the
church
and
the
republic
in
france
is


absolutely

in
its
origin

one
sided

the
church
is
no
more
necessarily


hostile
to
the
republic
as
a
republic
in
france

than
it
is
to
the


republic
as
a
republic
in
the
united
states
or
in
chile

or
in
catholic


switzerland

the
church
can
be
made
hostile
to
a
republic
by
persecution


and
attack
just
as
it
can
he
made
hostile
in
the
same
way
to
a
monarchy



neither
philippe
le
bel
nor
henry
the
eighth
was
much
of
a
republican






but
the
republicans
of
the
third
republic

in


would
learn
nothing


and
forget
nothing

they
met
the
protest
of
millions
of
voters
in
france


with
a
renewed
virulence
of
anti
catholic
and
of
anti
christian


legislation

with
an
increased
public
expenditure

and
with
fresh


political
proscriptions






their
purpose
and
their
programme
were
succinctly
and
clearly
summed
up


in
the
explicit
declaration
of
m

brisson

one
of
the
most
conspicuous


leaders
of
the
republican
party

that

the
republic
should
be


established
in
france

if
necessary

by
arms







what
is
the
difference
in
principle
between
such
a
declaration
as
this


and
the
attempt
of
the
third
napoleon
to
establish
an
empire
in
mexico


by
arms

in
the
one
case
we
have
a
proselytising

atheistic
republic


bent
on
abolishing
the
religion
of
an
unquestionable
majority
of
the


french
people

in
the
other

we
have
a
proselytising
emperor
bent
on


organizing
empire
in
mexico

in
the
light
of
the
doctrine
that


governments
derive
their
just
powers
from
the
consent
of
the
governed



the
one
undertaking
is
as
monstrous
as
the
other

the
undertaking
of
the


emperor
failed
disastrously
in
mexico

i
do
not
believe

and
for
many


reasons

that
the
undertaking
of
the
republic
will
succeed
in
france






one

and
the
chief
of
these
reasons

is

that
i
believe
the
hold
of
the


christian
religion
upon
the
body
of
the
french
people
to
be
stronger



and
not
weaker

than
it
was
before
the
propaganda
of
atheism
began

in


some
of
the
chapters
of
this
volume
evidence

i
think

will
be
found
to


show
this

under
the
plan
which
i
have
adopted
in
constructing
the
book



i
have
not
attempted
to
marshal
and
co
ordinate
the
evidence

i
have


simply
presented
it

where
it
presented
itself

either
in
conversations


had
by
me
at
one
or
another
place
with
persons
qualified

as
i
thought



to
speak
with
some
authority

or
in
observations
made
by
me
in
passing


through
one
or
another
region

it
was
a
part
of
my
plan
too

as
i
have


said

to
register

under
the
general
heading
of
one
or
another


department

not
only
what
struck
me
most
while
visiting
that
department


in
the
way
of
things
seen
or
heard
there

but
also
such
conversations


bearing
on
general
subjects
as
i
there
had

and
such
notes
as
i
there


made
from
the
books
bearing
on
french
history

which
i
took
with
me


wherever
i
went

as
this
book
is
not
a
treatise
but
a
record

as
it
is


not
intended
to
maintain
a
preconceived
thesis

but
simply
to
indicate


the
grounds
on
which
i
have
myself
come
to
certain
conclusions
and


convictions

i
thought
the
method
i
have
adopted
the
fairest

both
to
my


readers
and
to
myself

that
i
could
pursue









vi





but
as
the
point
i
have
now
touched

of
the
religious
condition
of


france

is
a
specially
grave
and
important
point

i
must
ask
my
readers


to
pause
with
me
upon
it
for
a
moment
here
in
this
introduction

i
am


especially
moved
to
do
this
because
i
have
reason
to
think
that
very


serious
and
very
extraordinary
delusions
on
this
point
exist
outside
of


france

and
especially
in
england

this
is
not
unnatural
when
we


remember
that
nine
foreigners
in
ten
take
their
impressions
of
france
as


a
nation

not
only
from
the
current
journalism
and
literature
of
paris


alone

but
from
a
very
limited
range
of
the
current
literature
and


journalism
even
of
paris

most
americans
certainly

and
i
am
inclined
to


think
most
englishmen

who
visit
paris

and
see
and
know
a
good
deal
of


paris

are
really
in
a
condition
of
penumbral
darkness
as
to
the
true


social

religious

and
intellectual
life
of
the
vast
majority
of
the


population
even
of
paris

we
see
the
paris
of
the
boulevards

the


champs
elysees

the
first
nights
at
the
theatres

the
restaurants

and


the
fashionable
shops

the

tout
paris

of
the
gossips
of
the
press



representing

possibly

one
per
cent

of
the
population
of
the
french


capital

of
the
domestic

busy

permanent
paris

which
keeps
the
french


capital
alive
from
year
to
year
and
from
generation
to
generation

the


paris
of
industry
and
of
commerce

of
the
churches

of
the
charities

of


the
schools

of
the
convents

how
much
do
we
see

there
are
a
number
of


prosperous
foreign
colonies
living
in
london
now

most
of
whose
leading


members
maintain
business
or
social
relations

more
or
less
active

with


one
or
another
section
of
the
english
population
of
the
great
british


metropolis

perhaps

if
we
could
get
a
plain

unvarnished
account
from


some
member
of
one
of
these
colonies

of
england
and
english
life
as


they
appear
to
him
and
to
his
compatriots

englishmen
might
be
as
much


confounded
as
i
have
known
very
intelligent
and
well
informed
frenchmen


to
be

by
the
notions
of
french
life
and
of
the
condition
of
the
french


people

really
and
seriously
entertained

not
by
casual
foreign


tourists

but
by
highly
educated
foreigners
who
really
wished
to
know


the
truth






not
long
after
the
legislative
elections
of


the
results
of
which


astonished
public
men
in
england
at
the
time
as
much
almost
as
they
did


the
satellites
of
the
government
in
paris

i
met
at
the
house
of
a


friend
in
london
a
very
eminent
english
public
man

whose
name
i
do
not


feel
quite
at
liberty
to
mention

but
who
is
certainly
regarded
by
great


numbers
of
englishmen
as
an
authority
without
appeal

not
only
in
regard


to
questions
of
english
domestic
policy

but
in
regard
to
european


affairs
in
general

in
the
course
of
a
general
conversation

there
were


ten
or
twelve
well
known
people
in
the
company

this
distinguished


public
man
expressed
to
me
his
great
surprise
at
the
importance
which
i



seemed
to
attach
to
the
religious
sentiment
in
france







i
assured
him
that
i
not
only

seemed

to
attach

but
did
in
fact
attach


very
serious
importance
to
it

and
i
ventured
to
ask
him
why
this
should



surprise

him






to
this
he
replied
textually

for
i
noted
down
the
remark
afterwards


that
evening

that
he
was

under
the
impression
that
the
religious


sentiment
was
dead
in
france








may
i
ask


i
replied


what
can
possibly
have
given
you
such
an


impression
as
this








oh

many
things


he
answered
with
great
emphasis


but
particularly
a


statement
which
i
saw
in
a
statistical
work
of
much
authority

not
very


long
ago

to
the
effect
that
there
are
in
france

five
millions
of


professed
atheists








all
who
heard
this
amazing
assertion
were

i
think

as
completely
taken


aback
by
it
as
i
was

courtesy
required
that
i
should
beg
the


distinguished
man
who
made
it
to
give
me

if
he
could

the
title
of
the


work
in
which
he
had
found
it

this
he
promptly
replied
that
he
was
at


the
moment
unable
to
do

he

however

very
nearly
asphyxiated
a
very


quiet
and
well
bred
young
frenchman
attached
to
the
french
embassy
in


london

who
was
present

by
appealing
to
him
on
the
subject


no

no




exclaimed
the
alarmed

attache



i
dare
say
there
is
such
a
book

no


doubt

no
doubt

but
i
have
never
heard
of
it







i
have
never
been
able
to
find
this
valuable
work

when
i
do
find
it
i


shall
institute
a
careful
inquiry
into
the
reasons
which
could
have
led


five
millions
of
french
persons

or
about
one
seventh
of
the
whole


population
of
france

to
take
the
pains
to
register
themselves
as



atheists


presumably
they
must
all
have
been
adults

as
the


declaration

on
such
a
subject

of
infants

would
scarcely

i
take
it



be
collected

even
by
m

jules
ferry

as
evidence
of
the
success
of
his


great
scheme
for

laicising

religion
out
of
france






meanwhile

i
find
it
set
down
in
the
usual
statistical
authorities


accessible
in


that
out
of
the



inhabitants
of
france






registered
themselves

or
were
registered

as
catholics





as
protestants



as
israelites

and


as

not


professing
any
form
of
religion







yet
i
suppose
that

if
the
eminent
public
man
who
saw

as
in
a
vision



these
five
millions
of
registered
atheists
marching
to
the
assault
of


christianity
in
france
were
to
announce
their
existence
as
a
fact
to
a


large
public
meeting
in
some
great
english
provincial
city
to
morrow

we


should
have
leaders
in
some
of
the
english
journals
a
day
or
two


afterwards
prognosticating
the
immediately
impending
downfall
of
all


religion
in
france

our
modern
democracies
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic


have
made
such
rapid
and
remarkable
progress
of
late
years
in
the
art
of


forming
opinions

that
if
isaac
taylor
could
come
back
to
the
earth
he


left

not
so
very
long
ago

he
would
hardly

i
think

recognise
the


planet






the
fashion
of
taking
it
for
granted
that
the
whole
world
is
fast
going


over
to
the
gospel
of
ganglia
and
bathybius

of

vox
populi
et
praeterea


nihil


is
not
confined
to
the

fanatics
of
impiety

in
france

i
have


heard
it
seriously
stated
in
a
london
drawing
room
by
another
public
man


of
repute
within
the
last
year

that
he
believed

mr

john
bright
and


mr

gladstone
were
the
last
two
men
who
would
ever
cite
the
christian


scriptures
as
an
authority
in
the
house
of
commons







the
uncommonly
good
english
of
the
christian
scriptures
may
perhaps


constitute
an
objection
to
their
free
use
in
addressing
popular


political
assemblies

but

admitting
this

i
hesitate
to
accept
the


statement

that
it
should
have
been
made
however

and
made
by
a
man
of


more
than
ordinary
ability

is
perhaps
a
thing
to
be
noted






but
i
revert
to
france






as
the
time
drew
near
for
the
legislative
elections
of


the


republicans
in
power
began
to
perceive
that
their
methods
had
not
been


crowned
with
absolute
success

the
awkward
corner
caused
by
the
enforced


resignation
of
president
grevy
had
indeed
been
turned

because
the


constitution
of
the
third
republic
provides
for
the
election
of
the


president
by
the
assembly

but
it
is
one
thing
to
play
a
successful


comedy
in
the
assembly
with
the
help
of
what
in
america
is
called

the


cohesive
power
of
the
public
plunder


and
quite
another
thing
to
get
a


satisfactory
chamber
of
deputies
re
elected
by
the
people
of
france


after
four
years
of
irritating
and
exasperating
misrule

much
was


expected
from
the
dazzling
effect
upon
the
popular
mind
of
the
universal


exposition
at
paris

so
much

indeed

that
i
have
had
the
obvious


incongruity
of
selecting
for
the
celebration
of
the
french
revolution
by


a
french
republic
the
centennial
of
a
year
in
which
no
french
republic


existed

accounted
for
to
me
by
a
french
republican
on
the
express


ground
that
the
legislative
elections
were
fixed
for


there
may


have
been
some
truth
in
this

for
nothing
could
be
more
preposterous


than
the
pretext
alleged
for
the
selection
by
the
french
government






this
or
that
thing
which
occurred
at
a
particular
time
in
a
particular


year
may
reasonably
be
made
the
occasion
of
a
centennial
or
a


semi
centennial
celebration

but
how
is
anybody
to
fix
and
celebrate
the



centennial

of
a
set
of
notions
called

the
principles
of








in
the
united
states
we
have
celebrated
the

centennial

of
the


declaration
of
independence

and
the
centennial
of
the
first


inauguration
of
the
first
president






did
the
french
government
intend
to
invite
the
monarchies
of
europe
to


celebrate
the
destruction
by
a
mob
of
the
bastille
on
july






hardly

i
suppose

or
the
convocation
of
the
states
general
at


versailles
on
may




certainly
not

for
the
states
general
were


convoked

not
under
the

principles
of



but
in
conformity
with
an


ancient
usage
and
custom
of
the
french
monarchy






what
are
the

principles
of








and
why
should
anybody
in
or
out
of
france
celebrate
them






if
by

the
principles
of


we
are
to
understand
the
principles
of


modern
constitutional
government

and
i
know
no
other
intelligible


interpretation
of
the
phrase

there
is
certainly
no
reason
why
anybody


out
of
france
should
particularly
concern
himself
with
celebrating
the


adoption
of
these
principles
in
france
any
more
than
with
celebrating


the
adoption
of
them
in
england

or
the
united
states

or
germany

or


spain

or
italy

the
principles
of
modern
constitutional
government
were


certainly
not
intelligently
adopted

and
certainly
not
loyally
carried


out
in
france

by
any
of
the
governments
which
tumbled
over
one
another


in
rapid
succession
in
that
distracted
country
between

and




have
they
been
intelligently
adopted
and
loyally
carried
out
in
that


distracted
country
to
day

that
is
a
question

i
think

not
hastily
to


be
answered






to
ask
the
people
of
england

of
the
united
states

of
germany

of


spain

of
italy

to
unite
in
celebrating
the
principles
of
modern


constitutional
government

under
the
name
of
the

principles
of





at
paris

as
if
the
world
were
indebted
to
paris
or
to
france
for
the


discovery

and
the
promulgation

and
the
adoption
of
those
principles



was
really
a
piece
of
presumption
which
might
have
been
pardoned
to
the


fatuity
of
the
abbe
sieyes
a
hundred
years
ago

but
was
hardly
to
have


been
expected
from
educated
frenchmen
in
the
year







this
was
stated

with
great
good
sense
and
commendable
courtesy
towards


the
french
government
responsible
for
the
absurdity

by
the
italian


premier

signor
crispi

in
the
chamber
of
deputies
at
borne

on
june











in
reply
to
an
interpellation
of
signor
cavalotti

addressed
to
the
then


foreign
minister
of
italy

signor
depretis

as
to
the
intentions
of
the


italian
government
with
regard
to
the
universal
exposition
of

at


paris

signor
crispi

then
minister
of
the
interior

made
a
striking


speech

signor
depretis
being
then
ill
of
the
disease
of
which
he


eventually
died


in
which
he
lucidly
and
forcibly
gave
the
reasons
of


the
italian
government
for
declining
to
take
any
official
part
in
the


matter

he
plainly
intimated
his
conviction

which
is
the
conviction

by


the
way

of
a
great
many
sensible
people
not
premiers
of
italy

that
the


business
of
universal
expositions
has
been
possibly
overdone

but



without
dwelling
upon
that
point

he
went
on
to
show
that
it
would
be


foolish
for
italy
to
isolate
herself
from
the
other
great
powers
by


taking
an
official
part
in
this
particular

universal
exposition


to


the
plea
of
signor
cavalotti
that
liberated
italy
ought
to
unite
with


france
to
celebrate

the
principles
of



signor
crispi
thus


replied


i
agree
with
the
honourable
member
that
we
are
sons
of




but
i
must
remind
him
that

was
preceded
by
the
glorious
english


revolution

and
by
the
great
american
revolution

in
both
of
which
had


been
manifested
and
established
the
principles
which
have
subsequently


prevailed
throughout
the
world







whether
the
treatment
of
the
sovereign
pontiff
at
rome
by
the
government


of
united
italy

since


has
been
entirely
consistent
with
the


principles
of
the

glorious
english
revolution


or
of
the

great


american

revolution


i
need
not
now
consider

but
that
all
the
living


political
doctrines
of
which
intelligent
frenchmen
mean
to
speak
when


they
talk
about
the

principles
of


are
the
american
political


doctrines
of


and
the
english
political
doctrines
of


admits


of
no
question

as
to
this

signor
crispi
was
absolutely
right

and
it


is
creditable
to
him

as
an
italian
statesman
and
an
italian
patriot



that
he
should
have
thus
early
and
publicly
declined
to
attach
the


liberty
and
the
independence
of
italy
as
a
bob
to
the
tail
of
an


electioneering
exposition
kite
at
paris
in


to
france
and
to
the


french
republics

first

second

and
third

italy
owes
a
good
deal
less


than
nothing

to
two
rulers
of
france

both
of
them
of
italian
blood



the
first
and
third
napoleon

she
owes
a
great
deal

but
her
chief


political
creditor

and
her
greatest
statesman

cavour

drew
his


political
doctrines

not
from
the
muddy
french
pool
of
the

principles


of



but
from
the
original
fountains
of

and


had
cavour


been
living
in


to
answer
the
interpellation
of
signor
cavalotti



he
might

perhaps

have
defined
more
sharply
than
it
was
given
to
signor


crispi
to
do

the
real
relations
between
the
french
revolution
of



and
the
national
developments
of
modern
italy

had
the
french
revolution


of

been
left
to
exhaust
itself
within
the
limits
of
france

it


would
probably
have
ended

as
the
friends
of
the
misguided
duc
d
orleans


almost
from
the
first
expected
to
see
it
end

in
the
substitution
of
a


comparatively
capable
for
a
positively
incapable
french
king
upon
a


constitutional
french
throne

in
that
event
it
would
have
interested


europe
and
the
world
no
less

and
no
more

than
the
fronde
or
the


religious
wars
which
came
to
a
close
with
the
coronation
of
henry
of


navarre

it
was
the
fear
of
this

unquestionably

which
drove
the


conspirators
of
the
gironde
into
forcing
a
foreign
war
upon
their


unfortunate
country

the
legend
of
republican
france
marching
as
one
man


to
the
rhine
to
liberate
enslaved
europe
has
much
less
foundation
in


fact
than
the
legend
of
itsatsou
and
the
horn
of
roland

it
is
a
pity


to
disturb
historical
fables
which
have
flowered
into
immortal
verse



but
really
there
was
not
the
slightest
occasion

so
far
as
europe
was


concerned

for
france
in

to

stamp
her
strong
foot
and
swear
she


would
be
free


m

de
bourgoing
s
admirable
diplomatic
history
of
those


days
makes
this
quite
clear

no
power
in
europe
objected
to
her
being
as


free
as
she
liked

on
the
contrary

england

even
in


was
both


ready
and
anxious
to
recognise
the
insane
french
republic
of
that
day



and
to
see
the
french
royal
family
sent
away
to
naples
or
to
madrid






pitt
was
too
far
sighted
a
statesman
not
to
be
well
aware
that
the


commerce
and
the
colonies
of
such
a
french
republic
were
the
natural


prizes
of
english
common
sense
and
english
enterprise

nor
was
austria


indisposed
to
see
the
house
of
bourbon

which
had
successfully
disputed


the
supremacy
of
europe
with
the
hapsburgs

humiliated
and
cast
down






the
french
revolution
became
titanic
only
when
it
ceased
to
be
a


revolution
and
ceased
to
be
french

the
magnificent
stanzas
of
barbier


tell
the
true
story
of
the
riderless
steed
re
bitted

re
bridled

and


mounted
by
the
italian
master
of
mankind

the
caesar
for
whom

so
quietly
waited

he
evoked

larger
than

shadow
of
that
colossal
figure

a
silly
tinkle

as
of

bells
in

the

principles

when
the
stage
rings
again
with
the
stern
accents
of
the


conqueror

hectoring
the
senators
of
the
free
and
imperial
city
of


augsburg

for
example

on
his
way
to
wagram
and
to
victory
twenty
years


afterwards







your
bankers
are
the
channel
through
which
the
gold
of
the
eternal


enemy
of
the
continent
finds
its
way
to
austria

i
have
made
up
my
mind


that
i
will
give
you
to
some
king

to
whom
i
have
not
yet
settled

i


will
attend
to
that
when
i
come
back
from
vienna







and

as
the
faithful
record
of
the

drei
mohren

tells
us


messieurs


the
senators
withdrew

much
mortified

and
not
at
all
pleased







nevertheless

when
the
conqueror
kept
his
word

and
having
made
a
king


of
bavaria
to
give
them
to

gave
them
to
the
king
of
bavaria

messieurs


the
senators

with
a
suppleness
and
a
docility
which
would
have
done


credit
to
debry

who
after
proposing

as
a
republican

to
organise





tyrannicides

and
murder
all
the
kings
and
emperors
of
the
earth



begged
napoleon
to
make
him
a
baron


made
haste
to
come
and
prostrate


themselves
before
the
new
bavarian
majesty
and
to
protest
that
until
the


fortunate
day
of
his
arrival
to
reign
over
them
they
had
never
known


what
real
happiness
was






if
there
is
one
thing
more
certain
than
another
in
human
history

it
is


that
but
for
the
english
revolution
of

and
the
american
revolution


of

the
world
in
general
would
know
and
care
to
day
very
little
more


about
the
french

principles
of



and
the
french
revolution

and


the
first
french
republic

than
the
world
in
general
knows
or
cares


to
day
about
the
wars
in
the
cevennes
or
the
long
conflict
between
the


armagnacs
and
the
bourguignons






napoleon
crumpled
up
the

principles
of


and
the
revolution
and
the


republic
in
his
iron
hand

and
flung
them
all
together
into
a
corner

he


meant
that
france
and
the
world
should
think
of
other
things

in



paganel

who

having
been
a

patriot

of
the
convention

had
naturally


become
a
liveried
servant
of
the
emperor
and
king

thought
he
might


venture
to
compose
a

historical
essay
on
the
french
revolution


he


dedicated
it
to
the
imperial
chancellor
of
the
legion
of
honour

and
he


wound
up
his
preface
with
these
words


and
thus
at
last
we
see
without


astonishment

after
this
long
series
of
errors

misfortunes

and
crimes



the
republic
disappear

and
france
implore
the
supreme
being
to


vouchsafe
to
her
the
one
great
and
potent
genius
who
in
these
difficult


circumstances
was
able
to
lift
her
up

to
defend
her

and
to
govern


her


the
heart
of
louis
xviii

would
have
been
touched
by
the
grateful


humility
of
this
repentant
wretch

but
the
emperor
simply
kicked
him


downstairs

he
forbade
the
book
to
be
published

the
whole
edition
was


put
under
lock
and
key

and
never
saw
the
light
till
liberty
came
back


to
france

with
the
white
nag
and
the
bourbon
lilies

in


surely


here
is
a
fact
worth
noting






had
this
first
history
of
the
french
revolution

written
as
paganel

a


member
of
the
revolutionary
convention

wrote
it

been
published
under


the
first
republic

the
author
would
infallibly
have
been
sent
to
the


guillotine

writing
it
under
the
first
empire
he
was
merely
snubbed



despite
his
fulsome
adulation
of
the
emperor

his
book
was
finally
given


to
the
world
under
the
restored
historic
monarchy
in







in


chateaubriand

having
been
elected
to
succeed
marie
joseph


chenier

the
brother
of
the
republican
poet
andre

murdered
by
the
first


republic

as
a
member
of
the
institute

prepared
a
speech
on
the


convention

to
be
read
before
that
august
body

napoleon
heard
of
it


and

without
troubling
himself
to
look
at
it

forbade
it
to
be


delivered


it
is
well
for
m

de
chateaubriand


he
said


that
it
was


suppressed

if
he
had
read
it
before
the
institute

i
would
have
flung


him
into
the
bottom
of
a
dungeon

and
left
him
there
the
rest
of
his


natural
life







napoleon
knew
the
first
republic
thoroughly

he
had
measured
all
its


men

and
all
its
records
were
in
his
hand

he
could
not
get
into
or
out


of
his
carriage
without
treading
on
some
incorruptible

patriot



prostrate
between
its
wheels
with
a
petition
for
a
prefecture

a
title


or
a
pension

the
crimes
and
follies
of
the
first
republic
had
made


france
and
the
world
sick
of
its
name

its
true
story
was
a
tale
of


shame
and
humiliation

not
fit
to
be
dragged
out
into
the
blaze
of
the


glory
of
imperial
france






the
first
republic
was
the
deadly
enemy
both
of
liberty
and
of
law

the


conduct
of
its
first
envoy
to
the
united
states
would
have
justified


washington
in
locking
him
up

when
a
stop
was
put
to
his
mischievous


impertinences

he
preferred
exile
in
america
to
the
chance
of
the


guillotine
at
paris

and
his
name
died
out

i
believe

curiously
enough



with
one
of
the
chief
instruments
of
the
notorious
tweed
ring
in
new


york






the
first
shots
fired
in
anger
under
the
american
flag
after
the
peace


of

were
fired
against
cruisers
of
the
french
republic
captured
in


the
west
indies
by
american
men
of
war

to
put
an
end
to
the
ignorant


and
insolent
attempt
of
what
called
itself
a
government
at
paris
to


issue
letters
of
marque
on
american
soil
against
english
commerce






so
grateful
was
france
to
the
emperor
for
restoring
the
reign
of
law



that
she
never
troubled
herself
about
liberty

and
but
for
the


indomitable
defence
of
constitutional
liberty
and
national
independence


which
england
maintained

often
single
handed

from
the
rupture
of
the


peace
of
amiens
to
the
victory
of
waterloo

the
very
names
of
the
chief


actors
in
the
odious
and
ridiculous
dramas
of
the
revolution
would
have


long
since
faded

as
napoleon
intended
they
should
fade

out
of
the


memory
of
the
masses
of
mankind









vii





how
little
confidence
the
government
of
the
third
republic
really
felt


in
the
efficacy
of
the

principles
of



and
of
the

centennial


exposition


to
save
it
at
the
polls
in

from
the
natural


consequences
of
its
intolerance
and
its
corruption

was
instructively


shown
by
the
absolute
panic
into
which
it
was
thrown
by
the
election
at


paris
of
general
boulanger
on
january


here

at
the
very
threshold
of


the
great
electoral
year

rose
the
spectre
of
the

man
on
horseback







certainly
general
boulanger
was
not
napoleon
bonaparte

the
government



which
had
itself
put
general
boulanger
on
horseback

knew
the
strength


and
the
weakness
of
the
man
himself

but
it
was
the
legend

not
the


man

they
dreaded

if
the
french
people

or
even
if
paris

really


believed
in
the
legend
of
boulanger

and
this
tremendous
vote
of
january



looked
very
much
like
it

it
mattered
little
what
the
real
value
of


the
man
might
be

the
legend
would
make
him
master
of
france

that
would


mean
for
the
third
republic
the
fate
of
the
first
republic
and
of
the


second

and
for
the
men
who
had
identified
it
with
their
own
fanaticism


and
folly

and
greed

and
incapacity

a
long
farewell
to
all
their


greatness






as
for
the
eventual
results

what
mattered
these
to
them






the
universal
exposition
might
collapse

or
it
might
be
opened
by


general
boulanger
on
his
black
horse

instead
of
president
carnot
in
his


landau

what
did
that
signify

but
it
signified
much
that
the
men
who


had
invented
president
carnot
were
not
likely
to
make
part
of
the



cortege

of
general
boulanger






it
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
from
january




the
government


of
the
third
french
republic
was
openly
and
visibly
given
up
by
night


and
by
day
to
one
great
purpose
alone

and
that
purpose
was

not
to


glorify
the

principles
of



not
to
celebrate
the
republic

the


grand
statue
of
the
triumph
of
the
republic

destined
to
be
set
up
with


great
pomp
in
the
sight
of
the
assembled
human
race

was
actually
left


to
be
cast
in
plaster
of
paris

no
functionary
caring
to
waste
a
sou
on


putting
it
into
perennial
bronze
or
enduring
marble

no

the
great


dominant

unconcealed
purpose
of
all
the
leaders
of
the
republic
was

in


some
way

no
matter
how

by
hook
or
by
crook

to
conjure
that
spectre


of
the
first
consulate

riding
about

awful
and
imminent

on
the
black


horse
of
general
boulanger






perhaps
the
high
water
mark
of
this
quite
unparalleled
and
most


instructive
panic
was
the
appearance

towards
the
end
of
the
last


parliamentary
session

of
m

jules
ferry

the
author
of
the
odious



article



the
man
who
after
hesitating

to
his
credit
be
it


said

originally
to
propose
that
ministers
of
religion
should
be


absolutely
forbidden
to
teach
the
children
of
france
in
her
public


schools

at
last
succumbed
to
the
vehemence
of
paul
bert

the
condorcet


of
this
modern
persecution

and
became
the
acknowledged
leader
of
the


war
against
liberty
and
religion

in
the
tribune
of
the
deputies

there


to
urge

and
indeed
to
implore

the
conservative
members
to
make
peace


with
the
persecutors

and
save
them
from
the
peril
of
boulanger






the
scene
of
that
day
in
the
chamber
of
deputies
was
not
one
to
be


forgotten

the
aspect
and
the
accents
of
the
republican
leader
were
at


times
absolutely
pathetic
with
the
pathos
of
unaffected
terror

it
was


difficult
to
believe

whilst
listening
to
him

that
he
could
really
have



five
millions
of
professed
atheists

at
his
back

encouraging
him
to


extirpate
christianity

root
and
branch

out
of
the
land
of
france






not
less
striking

in
quite
another
sense

was
the
grim
and
stony


silence
with
which
the
appeal
of
the
republican
leader
was
received
by


the
right

representing

as
the
third
republic
has
chosen
to
make
the


right
represent

the
religion

and
with
the
religion
the
liberty

of


france






it
reminded
me

i
am
sorry
to
say

of
the
way
in
which
a
naturally


amiable
and
considerate
householder
might
be
expected
to
listen
to
the


arguments
of
an
adroit
and
accomplished
burglar
showing
cause
why
he


should
be
locked
into
the
plate
closet
to
protect
him
from
the
police






m

jules
ferry
s
offer
was
to
suspend
the
application
to
certain


religious
bodies
of
the
interdict
fulminated
against
them
by
himself
and


the
republican
government

at
last
he
paused

evidently
oppressed
by
the


steady

unresponsive
gaze
of
his
hearers






then
the
silence
was
broken







do
you
speak
for
the
government


called
out
a
fiery
deputy
of
the


right






m

jules
ferry
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
replied


no

i
speak
for


myself

but
there
are
many
who
think
as
i
do








you


came
back
the
hot
response


you

bah


you
are
nothing







the
real
response
came
later

on
september


when

in
his
own
town
of


st

die

the
chief
of
the
opportunists

despite
all
the
efforts
of
the


prefect
of
the
department
and
of
the
local
authorities
to
carry
him


through

was
beaten
by
a
monarchist

obviously
m

ferry
had
heard
how


things
looked
from
his
committee
at
st

die
when
he
made
his
fruitless


appeal
to
the
eight
in
the
chamber






finding
that
nothing
was
to
be
expected
from
any
cajolery
of
the
right



or
any
transactions
with
the
outraged
and
awakened
christianity
of


france

the
government
at
last
gave
up
the
control
of
the
impending


elections
unreservedly
into
the
hands
of
m

constans
of
toulouse

of


whom
i
have
already
spoken

to
him

as
minister
of
the
interior

all


the
machinery
of
politics
was
abandoned

every
prefect
in
france
became


an
electoral
agent
to
do
his
bidding






for
the
first
time
too

i
believe

even
in
french
administrative


history

all
the
employees
of
the
post
offices
and
the
telegraph
offices


were
transferred
from
the
control
of
the
director
of
posts
and


telegraphs
to
the
direct
control
of
the
minister
of
the
interior






under
his
control
they
still
remain

and
it
is
now
proposed
to
attach


these
services
permanently
to
the
ministry
which
manages
the
elections



can
anybody
fail
to
see
what
this
means






at
the
suggestion
of
m

constans

too

the
government
resolved
to
attack


the
spectre

it
determined
to
drive
general
boulanger
out
of
france

it


is
not
easy
to
feel
much
sympathy
with
general
boulanger

who
while


minister
of
war
put
into
execution
against
the
comte
de
paris
and
his


family
a
most
iniquitous
decree

exiling
them

for
no
other
cause
than


the
fact
that
they
come
of
the
family
which
made
france
a
nation

from


their
country
and
their
homes

but
the
proceedings
which
the
government


of
president
carnot
took
against
general
boulanger
were
of
such
a


character
that
the
procureur
de
la
republique

who
was
first
directed
to


carry
them
out

withdrew
from
his
post

before
they
could
be
consummated


by
the
arrest
of
general
boulanger

he
suddenly
left
france

into
the


subsequent
action
of
the
senate

constituted
as
a

high
court
of


justice

to
try
him

i
need
not
here
enter






suffice
it
that
after
a
canvass
organized
in
this
fashion
and
in
this


spirit

and
prosecuted
by
the
government
with
remorseless
energy

the


elections
held
on
september

and
october

have
left
the
relative


strength
of
the
government
and
of
the
opposition
in
the
new
chamber


substantially
what
it
was
in
the
chamber
of


this

in
the


circumstances

can
only
be
described

in
the
language
of
one
of
the


ablest
republican
journalists
in
paris

m

jules
dietz
of
the

journal


des
debats


as

an
escape
from
a
disaster







the
repulse
of
the
assailants
at
the
redan
did
not
save
sebastopol
for


the
russians

the
margin
of
the
proclaimed
majorities
by
which
many
of


the
government
members
of
the
new
chamber
were
returned

is
so
very


small
as
to
suggest
of
itself
the
pressure

in
a
very
practical
and


concrete
form

of
the
hand
of
authority
on
the
returns
at
the
polls

in


twenty
cases
these
majorities
ranged
from

to

votes






in
one
case

in
the
seine
inferieure

the
details
of
which
were
given
to


me
by
persons
of
the
highest
character

with
perfect
liberty
to
use


their
names

the
government
member
was
declared
by
the
prefect

after


two
adjournments
of
the
counting

to
have
been
returned
by
a
majority
of



votes
on
a
total
poll

which
proved
upon
examination
to
very


considerably
exceed
the
total
number
of
voters
registered
in
the


district






but

taking
the
general
return
of
the
votes
cast
at
these
elections
as


authentic

it
is
perfectly
plain
that
the
monarchical
party
in
france
is


stronger
to
day
than
it
was
in


and
that
the
republican
party
is


weaker
in
france
to
day
than
it
was
in







in

the
strength
of
the
two
parties
stood
as
follows










republicans
of
all
shades

























conservatives
and
monarchists















































































republican
majority

































in

the
strength
of
the
two
parties
stands
as
follows










conservative
monarchists


























boulangists
























































































































































opportunist
republicans



























radicals











































socialists


























































































































































republican
majority

































here
at
once
we
see
a
falling
off
in
the
republican
majority

between



and


of
no
less
than


votes

this
is
certainly


significant
enough
when
we
remember
that
in

the
monarchists
did
not


everywhere
and
openly
attack
the
republic
as
a
form
of
government

while


in

the
issue
was
admitted
on
both
sides
to
involve
the
existence
of


the
republic
as
a
form
of
government






but
this
is
not
all






when
we
compare
the
total
of
the
votes
cast
in

and


we
find
a


diminution
of
no
fewer
than


votes

if
this
proves
anything

it


proves
that
the
voters
of
france
care
very
much
less
about
the
stability


of
the
republic
in

than
they
did
in


and
this
farther
appears


from
the
further
fact
that
the
falling
off
in
the
total
of
votes
cast


affected
the
republican
vote
of

much
more
seriously
than
it


affected
the
monarchical
vote

indeed
it
did
not
affect
the
monarchical


vote
at
all

on
the
contrary

while
there
was
a
positive
falling
off


from
the
republican
vote
of


between

and


there
was
a


positive
increase
of
the
monarchical
vote

between

and


of










how
is
it
possible
to
weigh
the
meaning
of
these
figures
fairly
without


seeing
that
a
form
of
government
which
exists
in
france
only
in
virtue


of
a
majority
which
a
change
of


votes
in
a
total
poll
of





would
have
turned
into
a
minority

can
hardly
be
said
to
rest


upon
as
firm
a
basis

for
example

as
that
of
the
third
empire

with
its


plebiscitary
majority
of
seven
millions
in

responding
to
its


majority
of
seven
millions
in







take
away
from
the
narrow
republican
majority
of

the
public


functionaries

high
and
low

now
counted
in
france
by
tens
of
thousands



with
all
who
depend
upon
and
are
connected
with
them

give
to
the
ballot


in
france
the
sanctity

freedom

and
security
which
it
has
in
england



compel
the
public
authorities
in
france
to
abstain

as
they
are


compelled
in
england
to
abstain

from
direct
interference
with
the


exercise
by
the
voters
of
the
right
of
suffrage

and
the
evidence
is


overwhelming
which
goes
to
show
that
the
third
republic
would
be
voted


into
limbo
to
morrow









viii





to
say
this
is
to
say
that
the
third
republic
does
not
exist
in
france


by
the
will
of
the
french
people

and
this
i
believe
to
be
absolutely


true

the
third
republic
exists
by
virtue
of
the
control
which
its


partisans
have
acquired
of
the
administrative
machinery
of
the


government

or

in
other
words

by
virtue
of
political
corruption
and


intimidation

so
great
has
been
the
multiplication
of
functionaries


great
and
small
under
the
third
republic

that
it
is
not
easy
to
get
at


an
accurate
estimate
of
their
numbers

the
best
information
i
have
been


able
to
obtain
leads
me
to
believe
that

exclusive
of
the
military
and


naval
forces

not
less
than
two
hundred
thousand
adult
french
citizens


now
draw
their
subsistence
from
the
public
treasury

this
represents
a


population
of
at
least
a
million
of
souls

so
that
we
have
nearly
one
in


thirty
of
the
inhabitants
of
france
subjected
to
a
direct
or
indirect


pecuniary
pressure
from
the
central
authorities
at
paris

so
openly
is


this
pressure
exerted
under
the
third
republic

that
the
government
of


m

carnot
did
not
hesitate

during
the
universal
exposition

and
not


long
before
the
legislative
elections
began

to
bring
up
no
fewer
than


some
thirteen
thousand
of
the
mayors
of
france
to
paris
at
the
public


expense

there
they
were
entertained

still
at
the
public
expense

with


a
sumptuous
hospitality

which
proves
that

however
orthodox
the


republican
atheism
may
be
of
m

constans

the
minister
of
the
interior



he
has
not
yet
struck
the
blessed
st

julian
out
of
his
calendar

at


least
when
he
is
spending
the
money
of
the
french
taxpayers
on
his


guests






if
i
may
believe
what
i
afterwards
heard
in
more
than
one
provincial


town

these
worthy
mayors

every
one
of
whom

let
me
observe

exercises


a
direct
personal
and
official
authority
over
the
elections

carried


back
to
his
astonished
and
envious
fellow
citizens
tales
of
arabian



tunisian

algerian

and
annamite
nights
at
the
exposition

and
on
the


champs
elysees

to
which
no
pen
but
that
of
diderot
or
of
the
younger


crebillon
could
do
adequate
justice


i
do
not
believe
the
sultan


said


a
clever
and
amusing
lady
to
me
at
toulouse


threw
open
the
doors
of


paradise
so
wide
to
the
german
kaiser

at
constantinople

as
did
our


more
than
liberal
m

constans
to
the
married
mayors
of
france
at
paris







on
the
other
hand

at
honfleur

in
the
calvados

it
came
to
my
knowledge


that
the
local
authorities

on
the
morning
of
the
first
legislative


elections

brought
over
from
another
port
on
the
norman
coast

a
number


of
sailors

residents
of
honfleur

and
entitled
to
vote
there

but


absent
in
the
pursuit
of
their
calling

these
honest
jack
tars
came
to


honfleur
by
the
railway

in
a
kind
of
brigade

accompanied
by
a


government
agent

who
marched
them
up
to
the
polls

and

having
seen


their
votes
safely
deposited
for
the
government
candidate

gave
each
man


his
return
ticket
for
the
next
day

and
set
them
all
free
to
spend
the


interval
in
the
bosom
of
their
astonished
and

i
hope

delighted


families






from
the
point
of
view
of
the
domestic
peace
of
france

this
proceeding


was
perhaps
less
reprehensible
than
the
belshazzar
s
feast
of
m



constans
and
the
thirteen
thousand
mayors

but
from
the
point
of
view
of


the
relations
between
the
third
republic
and
the
deliberate
independent


electoral
will
of
france

i
think
it
must
be
admitted
that
they
are

as


the
people
say
in
the
western
states
of
america


very
much
of
a


muchness







i
ought
to
add
that
in
france
the
mayors
of
the
chief
towns

or



chefs
lieux



the
arrondissements

and
the
cantons
are
nominated
by


the
government
at
paris

the
mayors
of
the
communes
which
owe
their


corporate
freedom
to
the
monarchy
are
elected

but
the
third
republic


has
taken
from
them
the
control
of
their
local
taxation
for
purposes
of


the
highest
local
interest

i
should
say
also
that
all
the
sailors
in


france
are
obliged
to
be
inscribed
upon
lists
kept
and
controlled
by
the


maritime
prefects
for
the
ministry
of
the
marine

so
that
their


whereabouts
may
be
known
or
ascertainable
at
all
times






americans
who
understand
the
institutions
of
their
own
country
find
the


true
measure
of
the
fitness
of
a
people
for
self
government
in
their


respect
for
the
authority
of
a
lawful
executive

the
fatal
mistake
has


been
made
by
the
third
as
it
was
by
the
first
french
republic
of


confounding
respect
for
a
lawful
executive
with
submission
to
an


executive
controlled
by
a
majority
of
the
legislature

the
fact
that
the


power
of
the
public
purse

in
a
constitutional
government

is


necessarily
confided
to
the
legislature

makes
this
mistake
fatal

fatal


at
once
to
the
liberty
of
the
taxpayers
who
supply
the
public
purse

and


of
whom
the
members
of
the
legislature
are
simply
the
agents
and


trustees

and
to
the
efficiency
and
integrity
of
the
executive

i
see


with
much
interest

while
the
sheets
of
this
book
are
going
through
the


press
in
london

that
this
very
grave
point
emerges
from
a
brief


correspondence
published
in
the
english
newspapers
between
the


chancellor
of
the
british
exchequer

mr

goschen

and
lord
lewisham



lord
lewisham

acting

it
would
appear

on
behalf
of
a
number
of
english


civil
servants

wrote
to
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
concerning


certain
complaints
of
these
servants

embodied
in
a
memorial

in
his


reply

the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
alludes
to
an
intimation
which


seems
to
have
been
made
by
the
authors
of
this
memorial
of
their


intention
to
put
a
kind
of
pressure
upon
the
minister
of
the
crown


through
the
house
of
commons

upon
this
mr

goschen
observes


the


memorialists
should
be
reminded
that
their
reference
to
an
appeal
to


their
representatives
in
parliament

involving

as
it
would
seem

a


personal
parliamentary
canvass
to
determine
the
relations
between
the


state
and
its
employes

contemplates
a
course
of
action
not
only


injurious
to
the
public
interests

but
opposed
to
the
best
traditions
of


the
civil
service







what
the
english
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
here
most
wisely
and


properly
condemns
as
a
mischief
a
brewing

has
become
the

jus
et
norma



of

the
relations
between
the
state
and
its
employes

in
france
under


the
third
republic






the
persons
charged
to
execute
and
enforce
the
laws
in
france
have
come



under
the
third
republic

from
the
president
downwards
throughout
the


civil
service

to
regard
themselves

and
to
be
regarded
by
the
people



as
the
mere
servants
and
instruments
of
the
persons
deputed
by
the


people
to
consider
what
the
laws
shall
be

and
to
adjust
the
public


taxation
to
the
necessities
of
the
public
service

the
result


necessarily
is
that
the
majority
of
the
french
chamber
of
deputies
under


the
third
republic
has
visibly
become
an
irresponsible
oligarchy
of
a


kind
most
dangerous
to
liberty
and
the
public
weal






by
calling
themselves

as
they
do

the

party
of
the
appeal
to
the


people


the
french
imperialists
show
their
doubtless
well
founded


conviction
that
the
masses
of
the
french
people
are
essentially


monarchical
in
their
ideas
as
to
the
best
tenure
by
which
the
executive


authority
can
be
held

to
believe
this

is
to
believe
that
the
masses
of


the
french
people
are
essentially
lovers
of
order

not
of
disorder

that


they
instinctively
put
the
executive
above
the
legislative
function
in


their
conceptions
of
a
political
hierarchy

and
therefore
that
they
are


essentially
fitted
for
self
government

in
this
i
am
sure
the


imperialists
are
right

but

unfortunately
for
them

the
centralised


administrative
machinery
of
government
in
france
by
which
the
french


people
are
now
and
have
for
a
century
past
been
prevented
from
governing


themselves

though
not
indeed
of
imperial
origin

was
so
developed
and


perfected
by
the
genius
of
the
first
napoleon
as
to
become
identified
in


a
sense
with
the
napoleonic
dynasty






it
is
a
great
misfortune
of
the
french
people
that
all
great
changes
in


their
political
system

no
matter
how
promoted
or
in
what
spirit

must


be
wrought
out
within
the
vicious
circle
of
this
centralized


administrative
machinery

the
initiative
in
liberating
france
from
this


centralized
administrative
machinery
can
only
come
from
within
the


vicious
circle
itself

an
independent
executive
of
france
made
chief
of


the
state
by
the
popular
will

and
protected

as
the
executive
of
great


britain
is
protected

in
the
interest
of
liberty
and
of
the
people

by


the
hereditary
principle

might
take
this
initiative
and
begin
the
great


work
of
so
distributing
throughout
france
the
administrative


responsibilities
and
powers
now
concentrated
at
paris
as
to
make
the


french
people
for
the
first
time
really
their
own
masters






certainly
no
executive
holding
power
by
any
tenure
less
independent
and


secure
can
ever
effect
this

that
a
real
basis
exists
upon
which
this


great
work
might
be
carried
out
in
the
local
life

traditions

ideas
and


sympathies
by
which
the
widely
different
populations
of
what
used
to
be


known
as
the
different
provinces
of
the
kingdom
of
france
are
united


among
themselves
and
discriminated
from
one
another

many
able
and


well
informed
frenchmen
believe

one
of
the
most
hasty
and
mischievous


things
done
by
the
infatuated
political
tinkers
of

was
to
cut
and


carve
up
france
into
arbitrary
political
departments
for
the
express


purpose
of
disintegrating
and
destroying
those
ancient
social
and


political
organisms






this
purpose
has
not
been
effectually
accomplished

what
has
been


accomplished
is
to
superpose
upon
the
ancient
organic
france
another


arbitrary
and
administrative
france

this
latter
arbitrary
and


administrative
france
controlled
by
a
legislative
oligarchy

which
first


makes
and
then
uses
the
french
executive
for
its
own
purposes

it
is


which
now
calls
itself
the
third
french
republic






the
traits
and
the
tendencies
as
well
as
the
origin
of
the
third


republic
can
be
thoroughly
studied
at
paris

without
paris
the
third


republic
never
could
have
existed

it
exists
now
in
virtue
of
the


political
machinery
of
which
paris
is
the
centre

that
it
could
not


withstand
for
a
day
any
severe
shock
given
to
that
machinery
was


confessed

as
i
have
said

by
its
own
government
in
the
abject
panic


which
followed
the
victory
of
general
boulanger
at
the
polls
of
the


capital
on
january









the
traits
and
the
tendencies
of
france

on
the
contrary

must
be


studied
in
the
provinces

there
was
always
more
wit
than
wisdom
in
the


famous
saying
of
heine

that
to
talk
about
the
opinion
of
the
provinces


in
france
was
like
talking
about
the
opinion
of
a
man
s
legs

the
head


being
the
seat
of
thought

and
paris
being
the
head

but
the
saying
was


uttered
during
the
reign
of
louis
philippe

and
long
before
the


establishment
of
universal
suffrage
by
the
second
empire

with
universal


suffrage
and
with
the
development
during
the
past
twenty
years
of
the


railway
and
of
the
telegraphic
system
throughout
france

the
importance


of
the
provinces
relatively
to
paris
has
greatly
and
steadily
increased



while
steam
and
electricity
have

of
course

increased
the
strength
of


the
pressure
which
an
aggressive
oligarchy
controlling
the
centralised


administrative
machinery
of
the
government
at
paris
can
put
upon
the


opinions
and
the
interests
of
france

they
have
also

it
must
be


remembered

increased
the
power
of
france
to
resist
and
to
resent
that


pressure

they
have
established
return
currents

the
force
of
which


grows
visibly
greater
every
year

the
great
provincial
towns
and
cities


of
france

for
example

are
ceasing
to
be
dependent

as
they
formerly


were

upon
the
press
of
paris
for
their
news
and
views
of
which
passes


in
the
capital






there
are
no
such
journals
yet
in
any
of
the
french
provinces
as
the


powerful
newspapers
which
are
to
be
found
throughout
the
united
kingdom



but
there
is
a
steady
and
very
notable
growth
in
the
circulation
of
the


more
important
local
journals

and
the
telegraph
brings
them
the
news
of


the
day
from
paris
long
before
the
parisian
papers
can
reach
their


readers

the
development
of
these
influences
has
been
checked

and
is


still
checked

by
the
official
control
at
paris
of
the
telegraphic


system

and
it
is
worth
noting
here
that

just
before
the
legislative


elections

the
minister
of
the
interior

to
whom
the
control
of
the
post


office
and
of
the
telegraphs
had
been
transferred

caused
the
telephone


offices
throughout
france
to
be
taken
possession
of
by
the
officials
of


the
government

though
the
negotiations
with
the
private
companies


owning
the
telephones
for
the
purchase
of
them
were
still
incomplete



and
though
the
private
owners
formally
protested
against
the
act






but
though
the
government
may
check
and
retard

it
cannot
prevent
the


development
of
these
influences

france

such
as
i
have
found
it

full


of
activity

full
of
energy

leavened
with
a
genuine
leaven
of
religious


faith

irritated
by
a
persistent
mockery
of
the
forms
of
liberty
into


prizing
and
demanding
the
realities
of
liberty

must
grow
steadily


stronger

the
republic
condemned
to
a
policy
of
persecution
and
of


financial
profligacy
must
grow
steadily
weaker






instead
of
trying
to
develop
france

or
letting
france
develop
herself


into
a
republic

the
partisans
of
a
republic
have
invented
successive


republics

each
more
grotesque
and
uncomfortable
than
its
predecessor



and
insisted
on
cramming
france
into
them

so
far
the
republics
have


gone
to
pieces
and
france
has
survived

so
intense
is
her
vitality

so


tough
appears
to
me
to
be
the
old
traditional
fibre
in
many
parts
of
the


french
body
politic

that
before
the
great
chapter
of
the

gesta
dei
per


francos

can
be
safely
assumed
to
be
finally
closed

a
good
many
more


milliards
will
have
to
be
spent
on
that
state
establishment
of


irreligion
and
disestablishment
of
god
which
the

true
republicans

of


the
third
republic
call

laicisation


long
before
those
milliards
can


be
raised
and
spent

the
third
republic
will
come
to
the
bottom
i


believe

if
not
of
the
purse

certainly
of
the
patience

of
the
french


people






it
is
already
admitted
on
all
hands
that
so
slight
a
thing
as
the


reappearance
of
general
boulanger
at
paris
on
september




would


have
completely
reversed
the
general
result
of
the
elections
of
the
next


day

the
birthday
of
the
first
republic
would
have
been
celebrated
by


the
funeral
of
the
third

the
failure
of
general
boulanger
then
to


reappear
may
have
made
an
end
of
general
boulanger

but
it
certainly
did


not
establish
the
republic






on
the
contrary

here
as
we
see
is
the
minister
of
the
interior

who


knows
the
situation
better
than
any
of
his
colleagues

invalidating


election
after
election
in
the
chamber
of
deputies

and
beginning
the


work
of
financial
reform
by
demanding
an
enormous
secret
service
fund
to


protect
the
republic
against
conspirators






sooner
or
later
this
tragi
comedy
must
end

it
concerns
europe
and
the


world
that
it
should
end
sooner
rather
than
later

and
that
it
should


end
with
a
pacific
restoration
of
france
to
her
proper
place
in
the


family
of
european
states

surely
the
most
imperious
necessity
of
the


immediate
future
in
europe
is
a
general
disarmament

no
french
republic


can
possibly
propose
or
accept
such
a
disarmament

no
french
empire
even


could
easily
propose
or
accept
such
a
disarmament

for
the
republic
and


the
empire
are
jointly
though
not
equally
responsible
for
the


humiliations
and
the
disasters
of
the
great
franco
german
war

the


historic
french
monarchy

restored
through
a
revision
of
the
existing


constitution
by
the
deliberate
will
of
the
french
people

might
propose


such
a
disarmament
with
a
moral
certainty
that
it
would
be
accepted



would
not
england
necessarily
stand
by
france
in
such
a
proposal

and
is


it
not
clear
that
the
refusal
of
central
europe
to
accept
such
a


disarmament
so
proposed
and
supported
would
make
that
alliance
with
the


russian
empire

which
is
impossible
to
a
french
republic

both
easy
and


natural
with
a
french
monarchy






i
should
have
visited
france
to
small
purpose
if
i
could
suppose
that


such
considerations
as
this
will
much
affect
the
masses
of
the
french


people

their
present
minister
of
public
instruction

m

fallieres

gave


his
measure
of
their
average
enlightenment
on
such
points
when
he


actually
called
upon
the
electors
of
the
lot
et
garonne
in
september
to


vote
against
m

cornelis
henry
de
witt
because
a
monarchical
restoration


would

be
followed
by
a
revival
of
the

droits
des
seigneurs


and

by
a


cossack
invasion







but
there
are
many
men
in
france
alive
to
such
considerations
as
this



and
these
men
have
many
ways
of
reaching
and
influencing
the
political


action
of
the
masses
of
their
countrymen






such
men
see
the
vital
relations
of
the
diplomatic
position
of
france
to


the
grave
domestic
question
of
the
public
expenses

it
is
difficult
to


ascertain
the
actual
cost
of
the
military
establishment
of
france
on
its


present
footing
of
an
armed
peace

but
french
officers
of
rank
assure
me


that
france
is
now
keeping
under
arms
at
least


men

or
more
than


one
in
seven
of
her
adult
male
population
available
for
national


defence


we
have
more
men
under
arms
than
germany


said
a
french


general
to
me
at
marseilles


which
is
absurd

because
the
german
army


for
fighting
purposes

in
case
of
any
sudden
trouble
with
us

includes


the
armies
of
austria

hungary
and
italy

so
germany
saves
money
on
her


peace
footing
which
we
idly
expend
on
ours


what
this
officer
did
not


say
to
me
has
been
said
by
many
other
well
informed
frenchmen

that
the


recent
military
legislation
of
the
parliamentary
majority
is


demoralising
this
great
military
force
and
threatens
its
efficiency

the


prominent
position
taken
in
the
new
chamber
since
it
assembled
by
m



raynal

a
radical
member
for
the
gironde
who
held
the
portfolio
of


public
works
under
m

gambetta
in

and
again
under
m

jules
ferry



is
not
of
good
omen
for
the
army

it
was
m

raynal
who
brought
about
the


fall
of
general
gresley
as
minister
of
war
by
an

interpellation




founded
on
the
refusal
of
the
war
minister
to
remove
an
officer
of
the


territorial
army
because
he
was
a
monarchist

and
now
m

raynal
appears


with
a
project
for
more
effectually
establishing
the
domination
of
the


parliamentary
majority
by
giving
it
the
right
to
adjourn
once
a
week
for


six
successive
weeks

all
debates
on
any

interpellation

to
which
the


government
may
object
on

grounds
of
public
policy







while
the
costly
army
of
france
is
at
the
mercy
of
legislation
under


such
conditions

the
navy
of
france
is
managed

as
appears
from
a


drastic
report
presented
some
time
ago
by
m

gerville
reache

an
able


republican
deputy
from
guadeloupe

with
at
least
as
much
regard
to


politics
as
to
economy

m

gerville
reache
showed
that
contracts
were


given
out
so
recklessly
that
a
supply
of
canned
provisions

for
example



had
been
laid
in
at
cherbourg
sufficient
for
five
years

at
other


stations
supplies
of
all
kinds
were
bought
at
prices
ranging
far
above


the
market
rates

and
circulars
were
produced
in
which
successive


ministers
of
marine
had
ordered
the
commandants
at
different
naval


stations
to

expend
every
sou
in
their
possession

on
no
matter
what




before
the
expiration
of
the
fiscal
year

as
any
excess
remaining
in


their
hands
would
not
only
be
lost
to
the
ministry
by
being
ordered
back


into
the
treasury

but
would
allow
opportunities
for
impugning
the


forecast
and
judgment
of
the
ministers


under
such
a
system
it
is
not


surprising
that
admiral
krantz

one
of
the
best
naval
administrators


france
possesses

should
have
been
forced
to
withdraw
from
the
tirard


government
to
satisfy
a
political
under
secretary

m

etienne






is
it
possible
that
in
the
actual
condition
of
france
and
of
europe
such


a
system
as
this
should
last






if
france
drifts
or
is
driven
into
a
great
european
war

one
of
two


things
would
seem
to
be
inevitable

if
the
french
armies
are
victorious



the
general
who
commands
them
and
restores
the
military
prestige
of


france
will
be
the
master
of
the
government
and
of
the
country

if
the


french
armies
are
defeated

the
government
will
disappear
in
a
whirlwind


of
national
rage
and
despair


in
that
event


said
a
republican
senator


to
me


in
that
event

which
i
will
not
contemplate

the
princes
of
the


house
of
france
would
be
recalled
instantly
and
by
acclamation

we


should
have
nothing
left
but
that
or
anarchy







but
putting
aside
the
crisis
of
a
great
war

what
other
alternatives


present
themselves
as
the
possible
issues
in
peace
of
the
system
now


dominant
at
paris






of
what
weight
or
avail
in
the
policy
of
the
parliamentary
oligarchy


which
calls
itself
the
third
republic
are
the
counsels
of
men
like
m



leon
renault

m

jules
simon

m

m

leon

who
have
tried
in


vain
to
constitute
in
france
the
conservative
republic
of

thiers

m



leon

left
his
seat
in
the
senate
before
the
recent
elections
and


presented
himself
in
the
pyrenees
as
a
candidate
for
the
chamber

with


the
well
understood
expectation
of
finding
himself
eventually
put
into


the
presidency
of
that
body

this
was
to
be
a
guarantee
of
the


conservative
republic






who
actually
fills
that
most
important
post






m

who
first
distinguished
himself
under

by
publicly


insulting
the
emperor
of
russia
in
the
palais
de
justice
during
the


visit
of
that
potentate
to
paris

and
who
resigned
his

for

the

for
this
m



floquet
was
arrested
at

and

up
at

till

how
can
france
hope
to
find
liberty
within
her
own
borders

or
peace


with
honour
abroad

under
the
domination
of
such
men






on

during
a
discussion
of
the
budget

in
the


french
senate

m

challemel
lacour

a
republican
of
the
republicans

who


actually
allowed
the
red
flag
to
be
hoisted
instead
of
the
tricolour
on


the
hotel
de
ville
of
lyons
while
he
was
prefect
of
the
rhone

and
who


represented
the
republic
for
a
time
as
ambassador
in
london

made
a


remarkable
speech

in
which
he
warned
his
colleagues
of
the
fate
which


they
were
preparing
for
the
republic

he
is
one
of
the
three
senators
of


the
bouches
du
rhone

and
one
of
the
four
vice
presidents
of
a
body
now


controlled
by
the
government

and
therefore
virtually
by
the
majority
of


the
chamber
of
deputies

he
is
more
than
this

an
elaborate
speech
of


his

delivered
in
the
assembly
on
september




in
which
he
denied


the

right
to
teach

as
threatening
the

moral
unity
of
france


was


the
signal
of
the
deliberate
war
against
all
religion
afterwards


proclaimed
by
m

gambetta

and
since
prosecuted
by
m

jules
ferry

out


of
that
speech
grew
the
policy
of
the
third
republic

yet
what
did
he


say
in


he
plainly
declared
his
belief
that
the
policy
of
the


government
was
driving
the
republic
headlong
to
its
ruin

he
spoke
as
a


republican

passionately
reaffirming
his
faith
in
the
republic

and
his


desire
to
see
it
solidly
founded
in
france


i
conjure
you

therefore




he
said


to
take
order

that
the
republic
may
once
more
become
the


reign
of
law

that
all
may
be
protected
in
their
persons

in
their


property

in
their
faith

not
only
against
disorder
in
the
streets

but


against
moral
disorder

moral
anarchy

defamation

calumny

against
the


fury
of
an
unbridled

uncontrolled

irresponsible
press

it
is
time
to


arrest
the
threatening
ruin
which
must
affect
the
humblest
lives

if
our


sad
fate
be
to
witness
the
catastrophe
of
liberty







m

challemel
lacour
is
an
orator

the
senate
was
shaken
and
roused
by


his
earnest
appeal

a
motion
was
made
that
his
speech
be
ordered
to
be


printed
and
posted
on
the
walls
of
paris

but
the
night
came

and
with


the
night
the
pressure
of
the
powers
indicted
by
the
speech

and
so
no


more
was
heard
of
it

and
the
budget
of

was
voted
by
the
outgoing


chamber

and
the
incoming
chamber
has
re
established
in
it
a
secret


service
fund
of



francs
for
the
minister
of
the
interior

and


the
work
of

invalidating

the
elections
of
troublesome
deputies
goes


merrily
on

and
in
the
remote
valleys
and
hills
of
france
poor
village


curates
are
mulcted
of
half
their
humble
stipends
for
the
offence
of


calling
upon
their
parishioners
to
vote
for
the
candidates
who
do
not


attack
their
religion






from
this
intolerable
position
there
are
two
obvious
ways
of
escape

one


is
the
familiar
parisian
way
of
the
barricades

that
way
is
not
likely


to
be
tried
in
the
interest
of
liberty
or
of
law

the
other
is
the
way


which
france
sought
to
adopt
in
the
recent
elections

of
a
deliberate


revision
of
the
constitution

now
hopelessly
perverted
into
the


instrument
of
a
parliamentary
oligarchy

the
actual
government
has
just


prevented
a
revision
in
the
interest
of
a
republican
dictator

which


after
all
must
have
been
more
or
less
a
leap
in
the
dark
out
of
a


window






as
between
the
only
available
window
and
the
only
available
doorway
of
a


dwelling
in
flames

it
is
intelligible
that
an
emotional
inmate

with


the
smell
of
the
fire
on
his
garments

should
make
for
the
window

but



the
window
being
barred

what
should
restrain
him
from
walking


rationally
out
of
the
doorway

any
one
of
a
dozen
possible
emergencies


may
compel
a
revision
of
the
constitution

and
any
revision
of
the


constitution
now
must
mean
either
a
radical
revolution

or
a
restoration


of
the
hereditary
executive

either
of
these
would
be
a
doorway

for


france
would
know
whither
either
of
these
must
lead

m

thiers

it
is


said
by
persons
who
ought
to
be
well
informed

might
have
led
france


thus
out
of
a
doorway
in


and
into
a
restoration
of
the
monarchy



m

thiers
was
an
exceedingly
able
man

but
it
is
hard
to
see
how
he


could
then
have
gone
about
to
achieve
this
result

france
in

was


still
a
conquered
country
occupied
by
the
german
armies

the
third


napoleon
and
his
son
were
both
then
living

the
comte
de
chambord
was


then
in
the
strength
of
his
years

the
comte
de
paris
had
not
then
taken


the
steps
which
he
afterwards
took
with
so
much
wisdom
and
moral


courage

to
make
an
end
of
the
rupture
between
henri
v

and
the
house
of


orleans






the
situation
now
is
materially
changed

the
imperialists
are
divided


between
jerome
the
father
and
victor
the
son

the
royalists
are
united



the
france
of
henri
iv

and
of
charles
x

is
represented
to
day
by
the


grandson
of
louis
philippe

the

vox
dei

and
the

vox
populi

meet
in


him
as
they
met
in
the
prince
of
orange
when
england

forty
years
after


the
criminal
catastrophe
of


was
driven
by
the
flight
of
james
ii



into
seating
william
and
mary

the
grandson
and
the
granddaughter
of


charles
i


upon
the
abdicated
throne






how
can
an
independent
executive
ever
be
restored
in
france
excepting
in


the
person
of
philippe
vii


had
the
revolution
of

never
occurred


he
would
now
by
the
ancient
law
of
succession
be
king
of
france
and


navarre

had
the
revolution
of

never
occurred
he
would
now
be
king


of
the
french
under
the
charter

if
the
era
of
revolutions
is
ever
to
be


closed
in
france

must
it
not
be
by
an
executive
who
shall
be
at
once


king
of
france
and
king
of
the
french

king
of

as
representing


the
historic
growth
into

and
unity
of

king

france
and
the
republic














chapter
i





in
the
pas
de
calais










calais





the
men
who

in


brought
about
the
formal
division
of
france
into


departments

no
doubt
thereby
facilitated
the
ephemeral
transformation



in
september


of
the
ancient
french
monarchy
into
a
french


republic


one
and
indivisible


but
they
also
put
their
improvised


republic
thereby
at
the
mercy
of
the
marvellous
italian
who
blew
its


flimsy
framework
into
shreds
with
his
cannon
in
october







in
working
out
what
george
sand
calls

the
great
practical
joke

of
the


first
consulate

and
the
formidable
reality
of
the
empire

napoleon


found

ready
fashioned
to
his
hand
and
undamaged
by
the
republican


tinkers

a
system
of
administration
essentially
despotic

this
system


did
for
him
what
charlemagne
did
for
himself
when
he
got
rid
of
the


tribal
dukes
of
the
merovingian
epoch

and

as
gneist
and
sir
robert


morier
have
shown

gathered
into
his
own
control
the
four
unities
which


make
up
the
unity
of
the
state

the
military

the
police

the
judiciary



and
the
finances

the
counts
of
charlemagne

removable
at
his
pleasure



with
no
root
in
their

comitatus

save
his
sovereign
will

were
the
true


prototypes
of
the
modern
french
prefect

if
the
old
provinces
of


france

which
had
a
local
life

organisation

and
spirit
of
their
own



had
been
taken
as
the
units
of
government
in


the
monarchy
perhaps


might
hardly
have
been
abolished
in

by
a
convention
so
headlong
and


tumultuous
that
for
one
day
it
actually
forgot

after
abolishing
the


monarchy

to
establish
any
government
in
its
place






but
if
a
republic
had
been
founded
through
the
action
of
the
provinces


of
france

it
would
probably
have
been
harder
for
napoleon
to
make
an


end
of
it

than
it
was
for
charlemagne
to
dispense
with
the
recognition


of
local
rights
to
which
the
merovingian
kings
had
submitted
in
the


appointment
of
their
hereditary

subreguli


from
among
the
local


magnates
of
the
shires

this

it
seems
to
me

may
be
inferred
from
the


fact

admitted
on
all
hands
in
france

that
the
departments
remain


to
day
what
they
were
at
first

mere
administrative
divisions
which
have


taken
no
hold
on
the
feelings
and
sympathies
of
the
people

while
the



local
patriotism

of
the
provinces
is
still
a
vivid
reality






frenchmen
are
still
gascons
and
provencals

bretons
and
normans



burgundians
and
picards

and
no
country
in
the
world
is
richer
than


france
in
local
histories
and
chronicles

but
so
late
as

the
local


history
of
the
department
of
the
pas
de
calais

in
which
i
am
now


writing

could
be
described
as

unique
in
france


and
this
local


history
is
really
a
history

not
of
the
department
at
all

but
of
the


two
important
and
interesting
provinces
of
which
it
consists

artois



namely

and
the
boulonnais

each
of
which
still
preserves

after
nearly


a
century

its
own
distinctive
character
in
the
physiognomy
of
the


people

in
their
habits

their
turn
of
mind

and
their
traditions

the


attempt
to
fuse
them
into
a
new
political
entity
has
completely
failed



no
more
has

apparently

come
of
it

locally

than
would
have
come
of


an
attempt
to
fuse
massachusetts
and
rhode
island
into
a
department
of


martha
s
vineyard

or
kent
and
sussex
into
a
department
of
new
haven



possibly
even
less

for
artois
and
the
boulonnais
never
passed


definitely
under
the
french
crown
until
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth


century

even
calais

after
the
duke
of
guise
had
wrested
it
from


england

was
conquered
for
spain
by
the
archduke
albert

and
a
smiling


little
agricultural
commune
alone
now
commemorates

in
its
name
of


therouanne

the
once
great
and
flourishing
episcopal
capital
of
morinia


in
which
clodion
began
the
french
monarchy

and
which
was
mercilessly


razed
to
the
ground
and
abolished
from
off
the
face
of
the
earth

little


more
than
three
hundred
years
ago

by
the
victorious
emperor
charles
the


fifth






of
this
artificial
department
calais
is
neither
the
chief
town
nor


capital

it
has
scarcely
a
third
of
the
population
of
boulogne

and
not


much
more
than
half
the
population
of
arras

which
is
the
seat
of
the


prefecture

and
though
it
is
by
no
means
so
dreary
and
uninteresting
a


place
as
the
casual
traveller

seeing
only
the
landing
pier

and
the
new


station

which
bears
the
name
of
the
heroic
eustache
de
st

pierre

is


apt
to
take
it
to
be

it
cannot
compare

in
point
of
beauty
and


interest

either
with
boulogne
or
with
arras

but
as
the
french
head
of


the
great
historic
ferry
between
england
and
the
continent

and
as
the


seat
of
sundry
thriving
factories

it
is
both
a
busy
and
prosperous


town

i
found
its
streets
swarming
with
people
and
its
houses
a
flutter


of
flags
and
banners

when
i
came
to
it
on
june




to
see
the



inauguration


by
president
carnot

of
the
works
on
which
the
french


government
has
been
spending
millions
of
francs
during
the
past
decade



with
an
eye
to
deepening
and
enlarging
the
harbour

the
weather
was


magnificent

several
men
of
war
of
the
channel
squadron
lay
off
the


port

excursion
steamers
came
in
from
england

bringing
members
of


parliament
and
miscellaneous
british
subjects

of
the
sort
once


indignantly
denounced
to
me
by
the
little
old
verger
of
a
midland


cathedral
as

them
terrible
trippers


the
active
and
good
natured


railway
porters
at
the
station
were
worn
out
with
throngs
of
travellers


pouring
in
from
all
the
country
round
about

there
was
much
animation


everywhere

but
nowhere
any
enthusiasm

though
calais

i
suppose

must


be
a
republican
town

as
at
the
election
of
a
deputy

held
here
in




the
government
candidate

m

camescasse

received


votes
against




given
to
his
conservative
opponent

m

labitte

i
am
told

too



there
is
a
good
deal
of
socialism
among
the
factory
workmen

and
i
can


see
that
the
place
is
full
of

cabarets

and

debits


flowing
not
only


with
light
beer
and
sour
wine

but
with
spirits
of
a
sort
to
make
the


consumers
more
clamorous
about
the
rights
than
solicitous
about
the


duties
of
man






i
heard

in
the
course
of
the
day

that
at
some
points
in
his
progress



the
president
was
received
with
cries
of

vive
boulanger


but
nothing


of
this
sort
passed
under
my
own
observation

what
most
struck
me
was


that
his
presence
appeared
to
be
not
an
event
at
all

but
merely
an


incident
of
a
general
holiday

nor
did
the
people
seem
to
care
much


about
the
real
event
of
the
day

the

inauguration

of
the
perfected


port

perhaps
they
knew
that
the
port
is
not
yet
perfected

those
of


them
who
went
down
to
the
pier
at
least
knew

this

for
a
steamer
of
no


very
great
size

the
st

andre

i
believe

trying
to
come
in

grounded


on
the
sand

and
lay
there
thumping
herself
heavily
for
i
know
not
how


long

i
heard
this
mishap
described
with
much
glee
by
a
group
of


boulonnais
in
the
main
street


ah
bah


said
one
of
them
exultingly




they
may
spend
what
they
like

calais
will
never
be
boulogne







i
breakfasted
with
a
friend
who
lives
much
on
a
property
he
has
in


picardy

and
who
came
down
to
calais
to
meet
me

when
i
first
knew
him



years
ago

he
was
a
republican
of
the
type
of
cavaignac
and
a
bitter


enemy
of
the
empire

some
of
his
kinsfolk
in
the
gironde
having
been


ill
treated
during
the
persecution
which
raged
against
the
republicans


and
the
royalists
alike

in
and
around
bordeaux

after
the

coup
d
etat



of
the
prince
president

of
later
years
he
has
been
growing
indifferent


to
public
affairs

and
is
now

i
think

simply
a
pessimist

whom
nothing


but
a
foreign
invasion
of
france
is
likely
to
rouse
into
activity
again







what
is
the
matter
with
the
people
here


i
asked
him


are
they


boulangists

or
do
they
simply
dislike
carnot








no


he
replied


i
don
t
think
they
care
much
about
boulanger

and
why


should
they
dislike
carnot

there
is
nothing
in
him
to
like
or
to


dislike

he
is
not
a
personality

he
is
only
a
functionary

and


frenchmen
care
nothing
about
functionaries

they
know
that
this
is
an


electoral
job

and
they
care
nothing
about
it

one
way
or
the
other








but
i
saw
an
inscription
on
a
banner
in
one
of
the
streets


i
said




to
this
effect


calais
always
faithful
to
the
carnots


does
that
mean


that
the
carnots
are
of
this
country








not
at
all

the
grandfather
of
carnot
was
born
in
burgundy
somewhere



he
married
a
young
lady
of
st

omer

and
in
that
way
came
to
be
sent
by


the
pas
de
calais
to
the

legislative

and
the
convention

the


inscription
is
amusing
though


he
added


for

like
these
other


inscriptions
reciting
the
names
of
lazare
carnot

and
hippolyte
carnot



and
sadi
carnot

it
shows
how
hard
some
people
are
trying
to
work
the


president
up
into
a
personality

they
want
to
make
him
out
the
heir
of
a


dynasty

carnot
iii









that
is
not
a
very
republican
way
of
looking
at
a
president


i


observed







possibly
not

but
it
is
a
very
french
way
of
looking
at
one

we
should


be
the
most
monarchical
people
in
europe
if
we
were
not
the
most


anarchical

give
a
public
man
a
legend
and
a
grandfather

and
he
can
go


a
long
way
with
us

i
don
t
know
that
the
grandfather
will
do
without


the
legend

even
when

as
in
this
case

the
grandfather
has
a
legend
of


his
own








is
that
legend
of
grandfather
carnot
very
strong
in
this
region


i


asked







neither
in
this
region
nor
anywhere
else


he
replied


i
think
it
is


very
foolish
of
the
managers
in
paris
to
provoke
comparisons
by
sending


a
political
bagman
to
germany
to
bring
back
the
ashes
of
papa
victory



as
the
prince
de
joinville
brought
back
the
dead
emperor
from
st



helena

carnot
i


after
all

was
simply
a
good
war
minister

who
loomed


into
greatness
only
in
comparison
with
the
rogue
pache
and
the


phenomenal
booby
bouchotte
who
preceded
him

he
was
certainly
no
better


than
his
successor
petiet

and
it
was
petiet

not
he

who
finally



organised
victory

by
sending
moreau
to
the
rhine

and
bonaparte
to


italy

napoleon

who
knew
them
both

made
petiet
governor
of
lombardy



and
chose
him

not
carnot

to
organise
the
great
camp
at
boulogne

when


petiet
died

not
long
after
austerlitz

napoleon
gave
him
a
much
grander


funeral
in
the
pantheon
than
can
be
got
up
now
for
the
grandfather
of


carnot

most
people
have
forgotten
petiet

and
it
is
a
blunder
to
remind


them
of
him

but
this
is
a
government
of
blunderers

see
what
trouble


the
ferrys
and
the
freycinets
are
taking
to
unmake
the
legend


clemenceau
made
for
boulanger

do
what
they
may

that
black
horse
is


worth
more
to
boulanger
to
day
than
carnot
s
grandfather
ever
will
be
to


carnot
iii








but
has
carnot
iii

no
value
of
his
own

has
he
not
shown
more
firmness


than
people
expected
of
him
when
this
boulangist
business
began








carnot
iii

is
simply
the
firm
name
of
ferry
and
de
freycinet

i
am
not


fond
of
the
scurrilities
of
rochefort

as
you
know

but
he
sometimes


hits
the
nail
on
the
head
very
hard

as
he
did
when

on
the
day
after


that
comedy
of
the
presidential
election

he
said

the
fact
that
a
man



if
you
ask
him
to
dinner

will
not
put
your
spoons
into
his
pocket
is


not
a
sufficient
reason
for
making
him
president
of
a
republic


only




he
added
reflectively


that
was
not
quite
their
reason
for
making
him


president

it
was
that
they
thought
he
would
let
other
people
pocket
the


spoons







this
reminded
me
of
what
used
to
be
said
of
secretary
seward
by
his


enemies

that
he
was

honest
enough
himself

but
cared
nothing
about


honesty
in
other
people








i
don
t
mean
that
exactly


said
my
friend


what
i
mean
is

that


carnot
iii

is
not
clever
enough
to
know
whether
the
people
around
him


are
or
are
not
honest

his
grandfather
was

carnot
i

would
have
cut
a


great
figure
in
our
present
senate

and
in
the
party
of
the

sick
at


heart


the
respectable
gentlemen

i
mean

who
are
always
consenting



under
the
stress
of
some

reason
of
state


to
vote
for
one
or
another


piece
of
rascality

though
it
makes
them

sick
at
heart

to
do
so



carnot
i

voted
in
this
way
for
the
murder
of
louis
xvi


and
he
takes


pains
to
tell
us
that
all
his
colleagues
in
the
convention
who
voted
for


it
did
so
in
dread
of
the
mob
in
the
galleries

just
in
the
same
way
he


was
sharp
enough
to
join
napoleon
during
the
hundred
days

because
he


saw
that
his
best
chance
of
saving
his
own
head
and
staying
in
france


was
to
keep
out
the
bourbons

this
carnot
iii

is

i
dare
say

more


honest
and
less
calculating

for
he
is
certainly
more
dull

than
his


grandfather

perhaps
he
may
turn
out
to
be
the
louis
xvi

of
the


republic







how
much
has
actually
been
spent
on
the
works
here
to
make
calais
a


great
seaport

it
is
not
easy
to
ascertain

but
the
lowest
estimates


stated
to
me
seem
to
be
quite
out
of
proportion
with
the
results


actually
achieved






my
conversation
on
this
point
with
my
friend
from
picardy
is
worth


recording







ten
years
ago


he
said


the
amount
to
be
spent
on
calais
was
set
down


at
eleven
millions
of
francs

i
feel
quite
sure
that
at
least
twice
this


sum
has
been
actually
spent
here
since
the
work
began
in









why
do
you
feel
sure
of
this








because
twice
the
first
estimate
has
been
avowedly
spent
everywhere
in


france
on
the
whole
scheme

calais
alone
figures
this
year
in
the
budget


for
sixteen
millions
and
a
half

you
were
in
france

were
you
not

in




and
you
must
surely
remember
the
songs
that
used
to
be
sung
in
the


streets











c
est
leon
say

c
est
freycinet





c
est
freycinet

c
est
leon
say








these
two
men

both
of
them
men
of
business

both
financiers

though


the

white
mouse



is
a
bit
of
a
visionary

and
both
men
of
ability



deliberately
adopted

in


after
a
single
conversation
with


gambetta

a
scheme
improvised
by
him

who
was
neither
a
man
of
business


nor
a
financier

but
a
declamatory
bohemian

for
keeping
up
the
war


expenditure
by
committing
france
to
the
creation
of
a
complete



commercial
outfit














this
is
the
popular
nickname
of
m

de
freycinet







the
republicans
won
the
elections
in

by
frightening
france
into
a


belief
that
a
conservative
victory
at
the
polls
would
be
followed
by
a


new
german
invasion

i
am
not
sure

mind
you

that
this
was
an
idle


scare

for
under
the
conservative
administration
of
our
affairs
we
had


cleared
off
in
six
years

time
the
frightful
burdens
imposed
upon
us
by


the
war

by
the
senseless
parisian
revolution
of


and
by
the


communist
insurrection
of


and
it
is
likely
enough
that
bismarck


may
have
made
up
his
mind
to
attack
us
if
he
saw
us
persist
in
a
sane


and
sensible
public
policy

be
that
as
it
may

gambetta

leon
say

and


freycinet

between
them

did
his
work
for
him
by
plunging
the
country


back
into
the
financial
morass
from
which
the
conservatives
had
rescued


it

they
carried
the
new
chamber
with
them
into
gambetta
s
scheme
for


doing
systematically
and
successfully
what
had
been
clumsily
attempted


in
the
ateliers
nationaux
of


france
was
to
be
made
a
republic
by


spending
nearly
the
amount
of
the
german
war
indemnity
on
the


construction
of
railways

canals

and
ports
all
over
the
country

the


sum
stated
in
the
outset
was
four
thousand
five
hundred
millions
of


francs

rather
a
pretty
penny
you
must
see








i
remember
it


i
replied


and
i
remember
thinking

when
the
scheme


was
first
developed

that
the
adoption
of
it
was
a
wonderful
evidence
of


the
financial
vigour
and
vitality
of
france








thank
you


he
replied
rather
bitterly


it
was
just
such
a
proof
of


vigour
and
vitality
that
dr

sangrado
used
to
get
from
his
patients
with


his
lancet

it
was
a
great
political
manoeuvre

no
doubt

and
it


commended
itself
to
all
the
hungry
politicians
in
france
so
promptly


and
so
warmly

that
within
three
years

time

in


m

tirard

who


was
then
finance
minister

and
who
is
now
on
the
box
of
the
carnot


coach

had
to
admit
that
the
expenditure
then
contemplated
in
carrying


out
this
great
idea
could
not
possibly
fall
short
of
nine
thousand
one


hundred
and
fifty
millions
of
francs

this

observe

was
seven
years


ago

to
day
it
has
swelled

at
the
least

into
eleven
and
perhaps
to


twelve
thousand
millions
of
francs

why
not

gambetta

leon
say

and


freycinet
proclaimed
the
millennium
of
civil
engineers
and
local


candidates

what
becomes
of
equality
and
fraternity
if
the
smallest


hamlet
in
the
recesses
of
the
jura
is
not
as
much
entitled
to
a
local


railway
at
the
public
expense
as
the
largest
port
on
the
bay
of
biscay



once
let
it
be
understood
that
the
government
means
to
spend
ten


thousand
millions
on
public
works

and
all
the
voters
are
ready
to


believe
the
government
has
found
the
philosopher
s
stone

nobody
but
the


tax
gatherer
will
ever
make
them
understand
where
the
money
comes
from



and
between
the
tax
gatherer
and
the
taxpayer

a
truly
clever
finance


minister
can
always
interpose
successfully

for
a
certain
length
of


time

the
anodyne
banker
with
a
new
form
of
public
loan

we
are
the


sharpest
and
thriftiest
people
alive
in
private
affairs

and
in
public


matters
the
most
absolute
fly
gobblers
in
the
whole
world







i
tried
to
console
my
friend
by
informing
him
that
this
particular
kind


of
political
financiering
is
not
unknown
in
my
own
country

the
scheme


of
gambetta
appears
to
me
to
be
simply
a
development

on
a
grand
scale



of
the

log
rolling
principle


on
which

year
after
year

a
measure


known
as
the

rivers
and
harbours
bill

is
engineered

with
more
or
less


friction

through
the
congress
of
the
united
states

it
is
regularly


and
diplomatically
fought
over
between
the
two
houses
until
an
agreement


about
it
is
come
to
between
the
opposing
forces

described
by
a
recent


american
writer
as

the
plutocracy
at
one
end
and
the
mobocracy
at
the


other
end

of
our
national
legislature

in
short

it
has
now
become
an



institution


and
like
other
institutions
it
has
its
legendary
hero

in


a
western
legislator
who
is
reputed
to
have
re
elected
himself
for
a


number
of
years
by

putting
through

successive
appropriations
for
the



improvement

of
a
stream
which
rose
in
an
inaccessible
mountain
and


emptied
itself
into
an
unfathomable
swamp







that
is
very
well


said
my
friend
gravely


very
well
indeed

but
you


have
to
do
this
thing
every
year

while
gambetta
and
leon
say
and
de


freycinet
committed
france
to
it
once
for
all
and
irremediably

and
on


what
scale
do
you
do
this
sort
of
thing







i
was
forced
to
own
that

upon
this
point

washington
so
far
lags


shamefully
in
the
rear
of
paris

our
grandest

log
rolling

in
finance


is

to
the
colossal
operations
of
gambetta

leon
say

and
de
freycinet



as
is
the
ordinary
iron
lamp
post
of
new
york
to
the
eiffel
tower






the

rivers
and
harbours
bill


in


was
only
saved
after
a


desperate
struggle
at
the
very
end
of
the
session

by
a
compromise
over


an

ancient
and
fish
like

canal
job
in
the
north
west

the
original


promoter
of
which

long
since
passed
beyond
the
hope

if
not
beyond
the


desire
of
hydraulic
improvements

audaciously
baptized
it
with
the
name


of
father
hennepin

one
of
the
glories
of
france
in
the
new
world

and


yet
the
amount
involved
in
the
bill
did
not
exceed
fourteen
million


dollars

or
a
beggarly
seventy
million
francs







at
that
rate


said
my
friend


it
would
take
your
great
country
more


than
a
century
to
match
what
we
have
covered
in
ten
years

and
yet
you


are
thought
an
enterprising
people

and

what
is
more
to
the
point

your


treasury
shows
an
annual
surplus

while
ours
shows
an
annual
deficit



and
you
have
nearly
twice
our
population

have
you
not

and
more
than


ten
times
our
area
of
territory







if
i
were
to

improve

the
roads
and
ponds
on
my
property
on
the


principle
on
which
france
has
been

improving

her
railway
systems
and


her
ports

i
should
bring
up
in
bankruptcy

where
else
can
the
country


bring
up

nothing

so
far

has
saved
us
but
the
woollen
stocking
of
the


peasants

come
to
my
place
in
picardy

and
i
will
show
you
a
dozen


old
fellows
who
go
about
dressed
in
blouses

who
work
like


day
labourers

no

much
better
and
harder
than
day
labourers
now
do



they
will
never
tell
you
what
they
are
thinking
about

they
will
never


tell
me

though
we
are
the
best
of
friends

but
you
will
see
what
they


are

close
at
a
bargain

shrewd

devoted
to
their
farms
and
families



well

they
live
on
a
third

yes

some
of
them
on
a
quarter

of
their


incomes

they
know
just
where
every
penny
they
have
spent
on
the
ground


for
twenty
years
has
gone

and
just
what
it
has
brought
back
to
them



and
every
man
of
them
can
put
his
hand

if
need
be

on
ten

twenty



thirty

forty
thousand
francs

that
is
the
woollen
stocking

but
the


most
beautiful
woman
in
the
world
can
only
give
what
she
has

the


woollen
stocking
holds
no
more
than
it
holds

you
can
find
the
bottom
of


it
if
you
keep
on
long
enough

and
then

and
mark
you

if
i
tell
the


shrewdest
of
these
old
fellows
that
the
government
is
spending
ten


thousand
millions
of
francs
on
building
railways
from
nowhere
to


nowhere

and
digging
ports
in
quicksands

what
will
he
do

he
will
begin


to
think
it
is
very
hard
that
he
can
t
get
a
railway
built
or
a
port


dug

do
you
wonder
i
am
a
pessimist








but
if
this
is
the
way
in
which
they
look
at
things

why
do
they


clamour
for
boulanger








they
don
t
clamour
for
boulanger

that
is
to
say
the
peasants

the


rural
people

it
is
in
the
towns

here
in
calais

for
example

at


boulogne

at
amiens

that
they
clamour
for
boulanger

in
the
towns
they


read
all
manner
of
trash
and
listen
to
all
manner
of
lies

you
can
get


up
a
legend
in
the
french
towns
for
anybody
or
anything
as
easily
to
day


as
in
the
middle
ages

perhaps
more
easily

look
at
this
legend
of


boulanger

it
is
a
real
legend
to
day

you
may
be
sure
of
that

and
that


is
the
real
danger
of
it

the
people
who
are
fighting
against
it
to
day


are
the
people
who
made
it

they
wanted

they
could
not
get
on
without



a
great
man

ferry
went
to
pieces

as
you
know

in


tonkin
and
the


dead
courbet
killed
him

so
they
invented
boulanger

they
made
him
war


minister

they
put
him
on
his
black
horse

they
let
him
drive
out
the


princes

look
at
those
five
men
seated
there
in
front
of
that
cafe

they


are
doubtless
decent
well
to
do
shopkeepers

master
mechanics

no
matter


what

i
will
wager
you
that
of
these
five
men

three
believe
boulanger


to
be
the
first
soldier
of
france

and
that
two
of
them
believe
the


government
has
driven
him
into
exile
to
prevent
the
germans
from


declaring
war

that
is
enough
to
make
them
boulangists








then
they
want
war
with
germany








yes

in
this
part
of
france
i
think
they
do

but
the
legend
is
just
as


effective
where
they
do
not
want
war
with
germany

last
year
i
was
in


the
country
of
grevy

not
far
from
mont
sous
vaudrey

there
the
peasants


dread
nothing
so
much
as
another
war

they
want
peace
there
at
any


price

well

then

a
very
shrewd
old
farmer
told
me
he
wanted
to
see


boulanger
made
chief
of
the
state

why

why
because

as
he
said



boulanger
is
the
first
general
in
europe

and
the
germans
know
it

and


they
go
in
fear
of
him

so
that
if
boulanger
is
made
chief
of
the
state



they
will
think
twice
before
they
attack
us

what
do
you
say
to
that








is
it
not
extraordinary


i
replied


that
this
legend

as
you
truly


call
it

should
have
been
created
so
easily
about
a
general
who
has
no


battle
to
show
for
it

not
even
a
montenotte

much
less
an
arcola
or
a


lodi








what
legend
had
bonaparte
when
barras
put
him
at
the
head
of
the
home


army

and
petiet
sent
him
to
italy

he
did
not
command
at
toulon

and


his
one
victory
had
been
to
blow
the
marshalled
blackguards
and
lunatics


of
paris
into
the
seine

as
mandat
might
and
would
have
done
on
that


dismal
august


but
for
that
hypocritical
scoundrel
petion

and
didn
t


the
authorities
arrest
bonaparte
after
toulon

and
was
he
not
struck


from
the
active
roll
of
general
officers
in
france
for
refusing
a


command
in
la
vendee

so
far
as
the
army
goes

there
is
better
stuff
for


a
legend
to
day
in
boulanger
than
there
was
in
bonaparte
when
he
went
to


italy







but
observe
that
the
government
made
a
legend
of
boulanger

not
for


military
but
for
political
purposes

they
were
shut
down
to
him

if
they


could
have
used
m

de
lesseps

and
if
the
panama
canal
had
been
a


success

lesseps
would
have
served
their
purpose
better
than
boulanger



without
a

great
frenchman


i
tell
you
the
republic
is
impossible

are


they
not
trying
to
make
a

great
frenchman

now
of
carnot

if
this
could


be
done

if
it
were
possible
to
make
a

great
frenchman

of
carnot

i


should
not
object

but
it
is
absurd

and
so
for
me

whatever
the


electors
may
do
in
september

the
republic
is
hopeless

they
made


boulanger
to
save
it

now
they
are
trying
to
unmake
boulanger
to
save


it

it
is
childish

it
is
silly

it
will
not
do

if
they
succeed
in


unmaking
their
legend
of
boulanger

where
are
they

not
even
where
they


were
when
they
began
to
make
it

on
the
contrary

they
have
made
it


perfectly
plain
that
the
republic
is
a
parachute
which
falls
without
a


balloon

where
are
they
to
find
the
balloon

the
exposition
has
given


the
parachute
a
lift

the
visit
of
the
prince
of
wales
gave
it
a
lift



the
shah

if
he
comes

will
give
it
a
lift

not
much

but
a
lift

but


all
these
are
expedients
of
a
moment

all
these
will
not
give
the


republic
a

great
frenchman









all
this


i
said


seems
to
bring
us
back
to
what
you
said
this


morning

that
if
you
were
not
the
most
anarchical
you
would
be
the
most


monarchical
people
in
europe








precisely

and
it
is
the
plain
truth

the
republic
was
possible
with


macmahon

for
after
all
he
was
a
personality

it
was
possible
with


thiers

for
though
he
was
a
little
rascal
and
the
greatest
literary
liar


of
the
century
except
victor
hugo

he
was
a
personality

and
a
very


positive
personality

it
might
have
been
possible
with
gambetta

for
he


too
was
a
personality

odious
and
flatulent
if
you
like

but
still
a


personality

it
was
not
possible
with
grevy

it
is
not
possible
with


carnot







let
the
elections
go
as
they
may

you
will
see
that
i
am
right

i
wash


my
hands
of
it
all

but
when
i
think
of
it
i
see
on
the
wall

finis


galliae


for
while
i
despair
of
the
republic

i
have
no
hope
of
a


monarchy

nothing
but
a
personality
can
carry
on
the
republic

and


nothing
but
a
personality
can
restore
the
monarchy







the
friends
of
the
poor
little
prince
imperial
understood
this
when


they
consented
to
let
him
go
off
to
south
africa

if
he
had
been
in
the


hands
of
an
english
general
of
common
sense

or
of
an
english
captain
of


common
courage

he
would
no
doubt
have
come
back
safe
and
sound

and
in


that
case
the
odds
are
that
we
should
be
living
to
day
under
the
third


empire
instead
of
the
third
republic







as
it
is

the
empire

between
the
significance
of
plon
plon

and
the


insignificance
of
prince
victor

is
like
the
republic
between
ferry

the


tonkinese

and
carnot

who
ought
to
spell
his
name

carton









but
how
is
it
with
the
royalists








ah

their
only

personality

known
to
the
people

and
that
is
the
value


of
a
personality
in
france

is
the
duc
d
aumale

and
who
knows
whether


the
duc
d
aumale
is
a
royalist

i
have
no
doubt

absolutely
no
doubt




he
said
with
some
emphasis


that
say
and
de
freycinet
to
morrow
would


gladly
join
forces
with
the
conservatives
to
make
the
duc
d
aumale


president
if
the
conservatives
would
agree
to
it

and
if
the
duc
would


accept
the
place

for
that
would
give
the
republic
a
new
lease
of
life


in
the
first
place

and
in
the
second
place
it
would
utterly


disintegrate
the
royalists

both
white
and
blue

if
the
duc
is
not
a



great
frenchman

in
the
electoral
sense
of
the
phrase

he
is
the
most


creditably
conspicuous
of
living
frenchmen

which
is
something








more
so
than
his
nephew
the
comte
de
paris








yes

certainly

in
the
popular
mind

personally

i
do
not
think
he


would
make
either
so
good
a
president
of
a
republic

or
so
good
a
king


as
the
comte
de
paris

whose
manifesto
i
think
shows
him
to
be
a
man
of


clear
and
sound
constitutional
ideas

but
the
french
people
do
not
know


him

it
was
a
blunder

by
the
way

in
my
opinion


he
added
after
a


moment


of
boulanger
to
expel
the
comte
de
paris

his
exile
and
his


action
in
exile
have
made
him
better
known
in
france
than
he
would
have


been

had
he
been
left
to
live
quietly
at
eu
and
in
paris

furthermore



what
sort
of
a
republic
is
it
in
which
a
family
of
princes
cannot
live


without
tempting
the
whole
population
to
make
one
of
them
king

the


expulsion
of
the
princes
belongs
to
the
same
category
of
political


idiocies
with
the

pacte
de
famine


either
the
republic
is
a
reality


accepted
by
the
french
people

or
it
is
a
sham
imposed
upon
them
by
a


party

if
it
is
a
reality

the
princes
are
simply
french
citizens

as


much
entitled
to
live
in
france
under
the
protection
of
the
laws
as
if


they
were
peasants

from
this
there
is
no
escape
logically
or
morally



and
the
men
who
voted
for
such
an
edict
are
neither
good
republicans
nor


good
frenchmen

from
the
moment
it
was
enacted
and
executed

the


republic
ceased
to
be
a
national
government

it
was
a

coup
d
etat

and


not
a
legal
act

and
every
legislator
who
voted
for
it
committed
perjury


at
least
as
distinctly
as
the
author
of
the

coup
d
etat

of


could


such
a
law
possibly
have
been
passed
in
your
republic








certainly
not


i
said


in
fact

the
people
of
many
american
states


are
free
to
treat
with
all
possible
public
and
private
distinction
a


personage
who
not
only
was
elected
to
a
position
which
may
be
called


princely

but
who
actually
exercised
for
several
years
a
greater


authority
over
millions
of
american
citizens
than
has
belonged
to
any


french
king
since
louis
xvi


and

exercising
it

waged
war
against
the


united
states

but
was
there
no
pretence
of
constitutional
authority
for


the
passage
of
this
law
which
you
so
strongly
denounce








certainly
not

there
was
no
shadow
of
a
legal
pretext
for
passing
it



it
is

i
think

the
worst
and
also
the
silliest
instance
in
our
recent


history
of
an
appeal
to
that
argument
of
rogues
and
tyrants
called



salus
populi


as
to
which
i
am
of
the
opinion
of
louis
blanc

that
the



safety

of
no
nation
under
heaven

is
worth
the
sacrifice
of
a
single


principle
of
common
justice








it
was
a
blow
struck
in
broad
daylight
at
the
personal
rights
of
every


french
citizen

just
as
the
removal
of
the
princes
from
the
army
was
a


blow
struck
in
broad
daylight
at
the
property
rights
of
every
french


officer

that
it
was
possible
for
a
government
to
strike
these
blows
in


cold
blood

with
no
popular
excitement
instigating
them

and
with
no


public
resentment
following
them

should
show
you

i
think

how
absurd


it
is
to
talk
of
the
french
people
as
a
republican
people

any


government
in
power
at
paris
may
be
as
arbitrary
as
it
likes

but
it


must
not
be
stupid

the
expulsion
of
the
princes
was
a
crime
against


liberty

it
was
as
arbitrary
an
act
as
the
issue
of
a

lettre
de


cachet


but
it
was
also
very
stupid

it
was
stupid
of
the
government


because
it
put
them
for
a
time
under
the
thumb
of
boulanger

it
was


stupid
of
boulanger

because
it
put
the
comte
de
paris
at
once
on
a


pedestal
and
forced
him
before
france
and
europe
into
the
position
of
a


saviour
of
society

for
whom
all
the
conservative
forces
of
french


society
must
henceforth
inevitably
work

whatever
becomes
of
boulanger


in
the
next
elections

he
has
condemned
the
opportunists
irretrievably


either
to
hew
wood
for
the
socialists
or
to
carry
water
for
the


monarchists

and
with
them
he
has
condemned
himself

wait
and
see
if
i


am
not
right







come
and
see
me
in
picardy

you
will
find
more
royalist
farmers
than
i


could
have
believed
possible
six
years
ago

if
the
comte
de
chambord
had


not
kept
the
legitimist
country
gentlemen
so
much
apart
as
a
caste
from


the
peasants

there
would
be
nothing
easier
than
to
sweep
the
country


with
a
monarchist
propaganda

it
was
the
royalist
peasantry
who
brought


about
the
great
emigration
in


long
before
the
terror

by
burning


and
pillaging
the
chateaux
all
over
france
under
orders
from
paris



which
they
believed
to
be
orders
from
the
king

what
puzzles
them
now
is


the
notion
lurking
down
in
the
bottom
of
their
minds
that
the


restoration
of
the
monarchy
will
somehow
put
the
country
gentlemen
over


them

and
this
has
much
to
do
with
making
them

not
republicans

but


imperialists

as
to
the
republic
the
overthrow
of
grevy
had
a
very
bad


effect
upon
the
peasants
and
the
farmers
in
my
part
of
the
country

and


i
believe
it
had
everywhere








was
m

grevy

then

popular
with
them








no

it
was
not
that
at
all

it
was
the
feeling
that
the
republic
meant


changes
and
uncertainty

a
farmer

a
fair
specimen
of
this
class
in
my


country

expressed
this
to
me
in
his
own
fashion
only
the
other
day

i


asked
him
if
he
was
coming
to
see
the
president
here
at
calais


what
is


the
use
of
that


he
said


it
is
money
out
of
pocket

and
for
what

who


knows
how
long
he
will
be
president

there
was
grevy

here
is
boulanger



all
that
can
do
no
good

with
these
short
leases
what
can
be
done
for


the
land


there
you
have
it

in
picardy
and
in
artois
the
people
have


long
memories
about
the
land

all
these
countries

as
you
know

were


fought
over
again
and
again

there
were
so
many
wars
that
people
got
out


of
the
way
of
making
long
leases

and
the
land
suffered
accordingly

in


the
last
century
these
provinces

now
so
well
and
so
richly
cultivated



were
in
a
very
bad
way
through
this

with
leases
of
three

six

nine


years

the
farmers
naturally
took
as
few
risks
as
possible
in
the
way
of


improving
the
land

they
were
always
making
up
the
waste
caused
by
the


previous
tenant

or
shy
of
investing
for
the
benefit
of
the
next
tenant



towards
the
end
of
the
century

and
before
the
revolution

small


holdings
began
to
increase

and
the
english
fashion
of
long
leases
came


in

and
the
agriculture
improved
accordingly

so
you
see
why
our
farmers


tend
to
monarchy
from
the
point
of
view
of
long
leases
and
land


ownership

just
as
these
sailors
and
fishermen
here
in
the
boulonnais


tend
to
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
seamanship

you
will
make


republicans
of
them
when
you
get
them
to
let
the
forecastle
elect
the


cook
captain

that
will
not
be
to
morrow
nor

i
think

next
week







i
left
calais
late
at
night
for
boulogne

my
friend
going
into
picardy



where
i
promised
to
join
him
later
on

there
was
an
immense
crowd
at
the


station

and
i
could
not
help
admiring
the
good
nature
and
cheery


civility
of
the
porters

the
sub
officials
in
silver
lace
were
not
so


admirable

but
then
they
were
only
strutting
about
and
objecting
to


things

the
honest
fellows
who
were
getting
twice
as
many
passengers


into
a
train
as
the
train
could
possibly
take

and
helping
bewildered


provincials
to
find
out
where
they
really
wanted
to
go

were

i
thought



miraculously
amiable
and
intelligent






at
the
last
moment

just
as
we
were
moving
off

a
lively
parisian


journalist
tumbled
into
our
compartment
with
his
despatch
box
and
his


portmanteau

he
was
in
the
full
evening
dress
in
which
he
had
been


parading
about
all
day
with
the
presidential
party

his
white
cravat
was


loose
and
awry

and
the
grey
dust
of
the
calais
streets
and
piers
lay


thick
upon
his
glossy
bottines

but
he
was
in
the
best
of
spirits

for


he
had
caught
the
train
and
would
now
reach
paris
in
the
morning







but
the
president
is
going
on
to
boulogne

is
he
not


i
asked







oh

yes

but
what
of
that

it
will
be
just
what
it
was
to
day

and
i


know
what
he
is
going
to
say

he
will
leave
boulogne
early
in
the


afternoon

and
we
shall
have
it
all

an
excellent
account

it
s
not


worth
while
to
waste
the
time
on
boulogne







he
had
been
with
the
president
ever
since
the
party
left
paris

and


thought
the
progression
the
whole

a
success


not
at
calais


that
he


admitted

there
had
certainly
been
no
great
enthusiasm
at
calais

he
did


not
think
there
had
been
any
cries
for
boulanger

but
there
was
no


emotion

this
he
explained
by
telling
me
that
the
people
had
not
been


properly


style




in
these
cases

you
know


he
said
with
the
air
of


a
connoisseur
in
enthusiasm


you
must
have
a
certain
subtle

stylage








the
word
was
new
to
me

but
not
so
the
thing

for
i
presently
found
that


by
a

subtle

stylage


of
the
people

my
companion
only
meant
what
in


america
is
known
as

working
up
a
boom


when
the
welfare
of
the
union


requires
that
a
president

or
a
presidential
candidate

should


perambulate
a
certain
number
of

doubtful

states

or

in
the


picturesque
language
of
the
days
of
andrew
johnson

go

swinging
round


the
circle


if
i
am
not
misinformed

an
analogous
operation
is


occasionally
performed
in
england

when
some
popular
idol
finds
it
worth


his
while
to
make
an
unpremeditated
political
tour







the
thing
was
better
done
at
lens


said
my
fellow
traveller


do
you


know
lens

they
are
all
miners
there

you
know

very
curious
people

i


suppose
they
were
glad
to
come
up
from
under
the
ground
and
look
at
us



some
of
the
women

too

were
pretty

really
very
pretty

it
was
all
very


well
arranged

there
is
a
good
manager
there

m






he
made
way

you


know

in


for
camescasse

to
oblige
the
government

the
president


gave
him
the
cross

it
had
a
very
good
effect

at
bapaume

too

the


president
did
a
good
thing

he
decorated





there

who
had
so
much


trouble
with
the
christian
brothers








for
having
trouble
with
the
christian
brothers


i
could
not
help


asking







no

but
the
courts
decided
against
him

and
that
was
a
misfortune

the


president
put
it
right
by
decorating
him

for
it
is
evident
that
he


meant
to
do
his
duty

and
a
government
must
stand
by
its
friends

do
you


know
bapaume

it
is
a
pretty
place

all
factories

it
was
there

you


know

that
faidherbe
beat
the
germans

a
very
pretty
place
















chapter
ii





in
the
pas
de
calais


continued











boulogne





boulogne
now

as
in
the
days
of
arthur
young

is
surrounded
with
bright


and
pleasant
villas
and
country
houses

though
many
of
the
chateaux


which
young
was
so
much
surprised
to
find
inhabited
by
country
gentlemen


attending
to
their
duties
and
living
on
their
estates
have
disappeared






it
is
not
only
a
larger
and
a
more
lively
place
than
calais

it
is
a


more
picturesque
and
a
more
interesting
place

the
old
walls
and


ramparts
of
the
upper
town
make
such
a
striking
contrast
with
the
modern


streets
and
squares
of
the
lower
town
as
reminds
one
vaguely
of
quebec



the
channel
coming
into
the
landscape
like
the
st

lawrence

as
at


quebec

too

the
two
civilisations
of
france
and
of
england
meet
without


mingling

and
at
boulogne

as
at
quebec

the
french
type

if
not
the


stronger
of
the
two

certainly
proves
itself
to
be
the
subtler

and


decides
the
local
physiognomy






i
spent
an
hour
at
boulogne

with
a
friend
who
now
fills
an
important


ecclesiastical
position
in
one
of
the
provinces
of
central
france

and


who
was
passing
a
few
weeks
on
the
channel
for
his
health

he
is
one
of


the
few
french
churchmen
i
personally
know
who
heartily
agree
with


cardinal
manning
in
thinking
that
the
abolition
of
the
concordat
would


greatly
strengthen
the
church
in
france

even
if
it
involved
a
further


serious
sacrifice
of
the
proprietary
rights
of
the
clergy


the
way
in


which
the
people
have
come
forward
to
the
support
of
the
congreganist


schools
against

the
oppressive
measures
adopted
in
the
law
of



he


said


confirms
my
old
conviction

that
a
complete
separation
of
the


church
from
the
state
in
france

whatever
its
effect
might
be
upon
the


state

would
strengthen
the
church







he
cited
a
number
of
instances
within
his
own
knowledge
in
which
rival


communes
had
established

and
were
carrying
on

at
the
direct
expense
of


the
local
farmers
and
residents

free
or
congreganist
schools

while

of


course

at
the
same
time
they
were
paying
taxes
for
the
lay
public


schools
to
which
they
would
not
send
their
children


and
this
in


spite


he
said


of
the
ingenious
devices
with
which
the
law
of



bristles
for
making
the
establishment
of
free
and
christian
schools


difficult
and
expensive

for
example

to
begin
with

the
legislature


actually
tried
to
prevent
us
from
calling
our
schools
free
schools



though
as
schools
supported
by
the
free
subscriptions
of
the
people
they


were
distinctly

free

schools

as
distinguished
from
the
schools


established
by
the
law
at
the
expense
of
the
taxpayers

we
were
gravely


informed
that
it
was
an
act
of
war
to
call
a
free
school
free

in
this


same
petty
and
childish
spirit
the
congregations
are
called



associations

in
the
text
of
the
law

when
a
free
school
is
to
be


opened

the
teacher
who
is
to
have
charge
of
it
must
run
the
gauntlet
of


a
series
of
public
officers

all
of
them

if
they
are
on
good
terms
with


the
government

presumably
hostile
to
him
as
a
christian

he
begins
with


the
mayor
of
the
commune

who
may
object
to
his
opening
the
school
in


the
place
he
has
chosen

on
grounds
of

good
morals
or
of
hygiene




then
he
must
go
through
with
the
prefect
of
the
department

the
academic


inspector

and
the
procureur
of
the
republic








that
is
to
say


i
asked


the
law
officer
of
the
department

why


should
he
be
brought
into
the
business








why

indeed


replied
my
friend


you
must
ask
m

ferry
or
m



clemenceau

he
can
stir
up
the
academic
inspector
to
make
some
objection


to
the
opening
of
the
free
school

if
the
academic
inspector
does
not


find
and
make
an
objection
himself

if
no
objections
are
made
within
a


month
the
school
may
be
opened

if
objections
are
made
they
must
be
made


before
the
council
of
the
department
within
a
month

if
the
council


support
the
objections

the
teacher
must
appeal
from
the
decision
to
the


academic
inspector
within
ten
days

and
the
inspector
must
submit
this


appeal
to
the
superior
council
of
public
instruction
at
the
next
ensuing


session
of
that
body

now
the
superior
council
only
meets
twice
a
year



and
as
the
appeal

according
to
the
law

is
only
required
to
be
heard



with
the
least
possible
delay


you
will
see
that
nothing
can
be
easier


than
for
the
academic
inspector
and
the
procureur
between
them
to
keep
a


decision
in
the
air
for
months

or
for
a
year

or
even
longer

and


pending
the
appeal
the
school
cannot
be
opened







as
for
the
departmental
councils

which
are
first
to
consider
the


objections
made
to
the
opening
of
the
school

they
no
longer
include

as


they
did
under
the
empire

representatives
of
the
catholic
clergy

the


protestant
sects

and
the
israelites

all
of
these
are
struck
out
of
the


councils
by
this
law
of


though
fully
ninety
nine
hundredths
of
all


the
taxes
paid
to
support
the
machinery

not
only
of
public
education


but
of
the
state

are
paid
by
the
catholics

protestants

and


israelites

nor
are
the
councils
any
longer
allowed
to
elect
their
own


vice
presidents

the
prefect

a
government

employe


presides
over
the


councils

the
academic
inspector

another
government

employe


is


officially
the
president

four
councillors
general

elected
by
the
whole


body
of
the
council
general
of
the
department

sit
on
the
departments
of


primary
instruction
council

as
do
also
the
director
or
directors
of
the


normal
schools
of
public
teachers

and
four
teachers

two
male
and
two


female

to
be
elected
by
the
whole
body
of
lay
public
school
teachers
of


both
sexes
in
the
department

all
of
them
paid

employes

of
the


government

and
finally

two
inspectors
of
public
primary
education


nominated
by
the
minister
of
public
instruction

so

as
you
see

out
of


a
council
consisting
of
fourteen
members

ten
are
paid
servants
of
the


government

directly
concerned
to
discourage
the
development
of
the


christian
schools

if
questions
and
disputes
between
the
lay
public


schools
and
the
free
christian
schools
came
before
this
council

one
lay


and
one
congreganist
teacher
may
be
admitted
to
join
the
council

but


the
wise
and
just
provision
of
the
earlier
law

that
two
or
more


magistrates
of
the
highest
repute
should
be
members
of
these
councils



has
been
deliberately
struck
out
of
this
aggressive
law
of








is
it
possible


he
said


to
mistake
either
the
spirit
or
the
object


of
such
a
law







what
gives
me
confidence
and
hope
is
the
unquestionable
effect
which


the
law
has
had
upon
the
religious
life
of
france

it
has
aroused
and


stimulated
it
to
more
vigour
and
energy
than
i
have
seen
it
show
for


years
past

if
only
the
church
in
france
were
to
day
as
free
from
any


official
connection
with
the
state
as
it
is
in
your
country

i
believe


we
should
see
such
a
revival
of
catholic
faith
as
has
not
been
known
in


europe
for
centuries







do
you
remember


he
went
on


how
ferry
went
to
rome
after
his


expulsion
from
power

yes

and
doubtless
you
know
what
efforts
he
made


there
at
that
time
to
bring
about
a
subterranean
understanding
between


himself
and
the
vatican








he
is
the
only
one
of
these
opportunists
who
really
has
a
head
on
his


shoulders

and
you
will
find
that
he
is
under
no
illusions
as
to
the


possibility
of
any
working
alliance
between
the
opportunists
and
the


radicals
which
can
save
the
former
from
going
to
the
wall

like
the


girondins
in








perhaps


he
said

laughingly


we
may
live
to
see
m

ferry
doing


penance
in
a
white
sheet

with
a
candle
in
his
hand

on
the
way
to
a


seat
in
a
monarchical
cabinet

though
i
am
no
politician

yet

mark
my


words


this
republic
has
been
so
mismanaged
that
now
it
cannot
live


without
the
radicals

and
it
cannot
live
with
them







as
for
the
church

if
you
want
to
see
what
life
and
energy
it
is


showing
in
its
work

come
and
see
me
in
the
autumn

i
will
show
you
in


the
limousin
one
of
the
establishments
of
the
congregation
of
the
holy


cross

or
you
can
go
into
mayenne
and
see
twelve
or
fifteen
of
them

or


you
ought
to
go
to
ruille
sur
la
loire

to
see
the
modest
cradle
of
this


great
congregation

which
now

from
its
mother
house
at
neuilly

is


sending
out
catholic
life
and
faith
all
over
the
world

and
the
pulse
of


which
is
beating
higher
in
france
to
day
than
at
any
time
since
that


true
and
simple
servant
of
god

dujarie

took
it
upon
himself

from
his


obscure
little
parsonage

to
begin
the
restoration
of
the
church
from


the
crash
of
the
terror
and
the
calamities
of
the
first
empire








how
many
years
ago
was
it


i
asked


when
this
congregation
began
its


work
in
the
united
states








not
quite
fifty
years
ago


he
replied


and

as
you
know

its
schools


are
flourishing
in
all
parts
of
your
union

from
the
university

in


indiana

of
our
lady
of
the
lake

to
new
orleans
and
new
jersey

and


from
wisconsin
to
texas

it
numbers
its
pupils

too

by
thousands
here


at
home
in
france







i
ask
you
to
join
me
in
the
limousin
because
i
hope
to
be
there
in


october

and
then
i
can
show
you
at
limoges
what
i
am
sure
you
would


like
to
see

one
of
our
best
cathedrals

and
some
beautiful
old
glass
in


st

michel
and
st

pierre

not
to
mention
the
enamels
still
hidden
away


here
and
there
in
certain
houses
i
wot
of












st

omer





two
of
the
most
interesting
places
in
the
pas
de
calais
are
st

omer



once
a
name
of
terror
to
the
worthy
englishmen
who
went
in
constant
fear


of
the
pope
and
wooden
shoes

and
aire
sur
la
lys

which
now
embraces


within
its
communal
limits
all
that
remains
to
day
of
the
once
famous


and
important
city
of
therouanne

the
ancient
capital
of
morinia

and


for
thirty
years
the
episcopal
seat
of
the
great
swiss
bishop

st

omer



who
made
north
eastern
gaul
christian
in
the
seventh
century






st

omer
still
preserves
a
certain
grave
and
austere
physiognomy



half
spanish
and
half
scholastic

and
it
is
easy
for
the
imagination
to


people
its
quiet
streets
with
the
english
and
irish
students
who


frequented
its
collegiate
halls
from
the
days
of
guy
faux
to
the
days
of


daniel
o
connell

but
its
importance
is
now
military

not
theological



m

pierre
de
la
gorce

the
accomplished
historian
of
the
revolution
of




who
lived
here
seven
years
as
a
magistrate

and
who
still
resides


here
because
he
finds
in
the
place

a
still
air
of
delightful
studies



congenial
to
his
tastes
and
favourable
to
his
historical
labours

told


me

in
the
course
of
a
most
interesting
afternoon
which
i
passed
here


with
him

that
the
town
is
full
of
families
living
here
on
their


incomes

and
in
going
about
the
streets
i
was
struck
with
the
general


air
of
quiet
and
unobtrusive
well
being
which
marks
the
people

in
his


position
as
a
magistrate

m

de
la
gorce
had
the
best
possible


opportunities
for
gauging
the
moral
character
of
the
inhabitants

and
he


assured
me
that
during
the
whole
period
of
his
residence
in
st

omer



extending
now
over
twelve
or
thirteen
years

he
has
never
known
more


than
one
serious
domestic
scandal
to
disturb
the
even
tenour
of
its


social
life

of
how
many
towns
of
twenty
thousand
inhabitants
could
the


same
thing
be
truly
said
in
england
or
the
united
states

during
all


these
years

too

m

de
la
gorce
tells
me

only
two
cases
of
alleged


misconduct
on
the
part
of
priests
have
occurred
in
st

omer

and
in
one


of
these
cases
the
allegation
was
proved
malignant
and
unfounded



politically

st

omer
seems
to
be
strongly
republican

in

it
gave


the
government
candidate
a
majority
of


votes
on
a
total
of





whereas
in
boulogne
at
the
same
election
the
republicans
were
beaten
in


the
southern
division

and
carried
the
whole
city
by
only
a
majority
of




votes
out
of
a
total
of








what
i
heard
in
st

omer
of
the
officers
stationed
there
was


particularly
interesting

there
is
a
large
garrison

and
the
greatest


pains
are
taken
by
the
officers
not
only
with
the
military
discipline



but
with
the
schooling
and
general
conduct
of
the
troops

my
own


observation
leads
me
to
think
this
true

not
of
st

omer
only

but
of


all
the
considerable
garrison
towns
which
i
have
visited
in
france


during
the
past
six
or
seven
years

the
old
type
of
swashbuckling



absinthe
tippling

rakehelly
french
officer
of
whom

during
the
last


years
of
the
empire

one
saw
and
heard
so
much

seems
to
have
passed


away
into
history
and
literature

however
it
may
be
with
the



gaiter
buttons

in
the
next
great
war

i
do
not
believe
the
staff
of


the
next
invading
army
will
have
much
to
teach
the
french
officers
of


to
day

either
about
the
principles
of
scientific
warfare
or
about
the


topography
of
france






i
am
inclined
to
think
that
there
are
more
french
officers
in
st

omer


alone
to
day
who
can
read
and
understand
german
than
there
were
in
all


france
in


the

morale

and
carriage
of
the
soldiers

too

are


distinctly
higher

the
calling
of
men
of
all
ranks
and
conditions
under


the
colours
has
necessarily
raised
the
moral
and
social
level
of
the


rank
and
file
as
well
as
of
the
officers

and
it
is
quite
certain
that


the
army
holds
a
higher
place
in
the
estimation
of
the
better
classes
in


france
than
it
used
to
hold

m

de
la
gorce
cited
to
me
several


instances

here
at
st

omer

of
young
ladies
of
excellent
family

three


of
them
at
least
considerable
heiresses

who
have
married
young
officers


of
merit
solely
because
they
were
officers
of
merit

and
who
have
gladly


turned
their
backs
on
the
flutter
and
glitter
of
fashionable
paris
to


share
the
quiet

unpretending
quarters

and
take
a
sympathetic
interest


in
the
serious
military
career
of
their
husbands
in
this
rather


out
of
the
way
garrison
town






i
do
not
find
m

de
la
gorce
sanguine
as
to
any
early
solution
of
the


political
problems
with
which
france
is
still
wrestling
after
a
hundred


years

he
makes
no
secret
of
his
conviction
that
nothing
but
a
return
to


the
constitutional
monarchy
can
give
the
country
lasting
peace
at
home



or
real
influence
abroad

but
his
impression
seems
to
be
that
time
alone


can
bring
this
about

he
would
have
the
royalists
unfurl
their
banner



go
into
the
elections
with
a
plain
declaration
of
their
political
creed



and
await
the
progress
of
events

he
cited

as
a
proof
of
the
wisdom
of


this
policy

the
steady
advance
made
by
the
republicans
after
a
mere


handful
of
them
came
into
the
imperial
legislature

they
grew
from
five


to
thirty

simply
because
they
stood
firmly
on
their
own
principles



while
the
majority
were
disturbed
and
uncertain

the
principle
of
the


hereditary
constitutional
monarchy

he
thought

should
be
plainly


affirmed
and
presented
to
the
french
people

as
their
only
real


safeguard
against
the
incessant
disturbance
and
displacement
of
the


executive
machinery
which
results
from
the
election
of
an
executive


chief







let
this
be
affirmed
and
presented


said
m

de
la
gorce


by
a


number

no
matter
how
small
it
may
be
at
first

of
sincere
and
resolute


men

and
every
successive
shock
and
catastrophe
will
bring
more
and
more


support
to
them
from
all
classes
in
france







m

de
la
gorce
is
of
the
opinion
that
the
laicisation
of
the
schools



whatever
may
be
said
of
the
motives
and
intent
of
those
who
have


promoted
it

has
had
a
good
effect
on
the
congreganist
schools

by


stimulating
the
teachers
and
directors
to
make
greater
efforts
for
the


improvement
of
their
methods
and
their
general
machinery
of
instruction



this
is
quite
in
accord
with
the
views
of
my
friend
whom
i
met
at


boulogne

and
indeed
it
is
in
the
nature
of
things






the
way
in
which
the
laicisation
is
carried
out
by
the
subaltern


authorities
seems
to
be
admirably
calculated
also
to
inflame
the


religious
zeal
of
the
people

a
very
intelligent
and
liberal


ecclesiastic

living
here

tells
me
that

while
m

ferry
is
professing


in
the
chamber
his
great
anxiety
to
co
operate
with
the
conservatives
in


modifying
the
decrees
of


in
regard
to
religious
associations

and


talking
about
a
more
liberal
treatment
of
the
clergy
and
the
christian


free
schools

the
local
functionaries
here

in
artois

lose
no


opportunity
of
irritating
and
annoying
the
christian
population

in
the


village
of
moislains
near
peronne

for
example

he
tells
me
the
funeral


took
place
the
other
day
of
the
abbe
sallier

for
many
years
the
cure
of


that
parish

a
man
so
much
respected
and
beloved
by
the
whole
community


that

notwithstanding
an
express
request
made
by
him
in
his
will

that


no
discourse
might
be
pronounced
at
his
interment

and
that
it
might
be


made
as
simple
as
possible

the
people
insisted
on
escorting
the
remains


to
the
cemetery
in
a
long
procession
headed
by
the
mayor

the
municipal


council

and
all
the
notabilities
of
the
country
round
about

naturally


the
people
wished
that
their
children

most
of
whom
had
been
baptized
by


the
abbe

might
join
in
this
procession

to
prevent
which
an
express


order
was
issued
by
the
school
authorities

that
the
children
should
not


be
allowed
to
leave
the
school
for
that
purpose

it
is
difficult
to
see


how
a
petty
persecution
of
this
sort
can
be
expected
to
promote
the



religious
peace

about
which
m

ferry
perorates
at
paris

the
rural


artesians

my
friend
tells
me

resent
these
proceedings
very
bitterly



and
show
their
feelings
in
the
most
practical
fashion

by
subscribing


freely
to
carry
on
the
religious
primary
schools

and
refusing
to
let


their
children
attend
the
lay
schools

which
are
kept
up
by
the


government
out
of
the
taxes
paid
by
themselves

this

with
a
thrifty
and


rather
parsimonious
population

like
that
which
increases
and
multiplies


so
steadily
in
artois

is
a
most
significant
fact






the
marist
brethren

who
have
their
headquarter
at
the
ecole
de
notre


dame
in
albert

a
town
of
some


inhabitants

about
half
way
between


arras
and
amiens

are
carrying
on
these
religious
schools
most


successfully

albert
itself
is
a
very
curious
and
interesting
place



there
are
remains
here
of
roman
fortifications
which
show
that
it
was
a


point
of
importance
under
the
empire

and
subterranean
excavations
of
a


most
remarkable
character

one
of
them
extending
for
more
than
two


miles

down
to
the
time
of
henry
iv

albert
was
known
as
ancre

concini



the
florentine
favourite
of
mary
de

medici

bought
the
lordship
of


ancre
with
the
title
of
marquis

with
the
help
of
his
clever
florentine


wife

leonora
galigai

he
completely
subjugated
the
queen
and
her
weak


son

louis
xiii


and

without
so
much
as
drawing
his
sword
in
battle



made
himself
a
marshal
of
france

how
all
this
led
him
on
to
his
ruin
i


need
not
recite

he
was
stabbed
to
death
in
the
precincts
of
the
louvre


by
vitry

his
wife

arraigned
as
a
sorceress

was
strangled
and
burned



and
their
unfortunate
little
son
was
degraded

the
marquisate
and


lordship
of
ancre
were
bought

oddly
enough

by
another
and
very


different
florentine
race

the
alberti

who
had
come
into
france
and


established
themselves
in
the
venaissin
a
hundred
years
before

so


intense
was
the
general
hatred
of
the
concinis

that

upon
acquiring


ancre

the
alberti
unbaptized
the
place
and
gave
it
their
own
french


name
of
albert

which
is
still
most
honourably
borne
by
their


representatives

the
ducal
houses
of
luynes
and
of
chaulnes

it
is


common
enough
in
france

as
it
is
in
england

to
find
the
names
of


families
perpetuated
in
conjunction
with
those
of
places
once
their


property

kingston
lacy

stanton
harcourt

bagot
s
bromley

melton


mowbray
are
english
cases
in
point

but
this
displacement
of
an
old


territorial
designation
by
a
family
name
is
unusual

some
thing
like
it


has
taken
place
in
our
own
times
and
in
a
remote
south
western
corner
of


france

where
the
people
of
arles
les
bains
changed
the
name
of
their


pleasant
little
town
of
orange
groves
and
olives
to
amelie

to


commemorate
their
respect
and
affection
for
the
excellent
queen
of
louis


philippe






there
are
factories
at
albert

and
a
modern
church
is
building
there



not
to
the
unmixed
delight
of
architects
and
archaeologists

but
my


concern
now
is
with
the
work
of
the
marist
brothers
who
have
made
albert


their
headquarters






this
work
is
carried
on
with
the
direct
and
active
co
operation
of
the


people

at
one
little
hamlet

for
example

called

i
think

brebieres



nearly
a
hundred
children
now
attend
the
marist
school

whose
parents


pay
for
each
child
a
subscription
of
three
francs
a
month

there

not


long
ago

it
was
found
that
in
one
poor
family
of
peasants
a
family


council
had
been
called
to
raise
this
modest
sum
in
order
that
one
of


the
children
now
of
an
age
to
attend
the
school
might
be
sent
to
it

the


two
elder
children
settled
the
question
by
insisting
that
they
would


give
up
their
own
daily
ration
of
milk
to
meet
the
expense






will
france
be
a
nobler
and
stronger
country
when
the
priests
who
train


the
children
of
her
peasantry
into
this
spirit
are
driven
out
of
the


land






this
is
the
real
question
which
must
be
met
and
answered
by
the


advocates
of
compulsory
lay
education
in
the
public
schools






the
next
step
to
be
taken
in
the

laicisation

of
the
schools
has
been


already
revealed
in
the
famous

article


of
m

ferry

m

ferry
is
the


true

though
more
or
less
occult

head
of
the
present
administration
in


france


m

ferry


said
a
caustic
french
radical
to
me
in
paris


ought


to
be
the
mask
of
m

carnot

nature
gave
him
a
carnival
nose
for
that


purpose

everything
is
topsy
turvy
now
in
france

and
so
m

carnot
is


the
mask
of
m

ferry

but
the
nose
will
come
through
before
long







many
years
ago
the
public
conscience
of
philadelphia

then
as
now
one
of


the
most
protestant
of
american
protestant
cities

was
scandalised
by


the
will
of
a
french
merchant

stephen
girard

who

after
acquiring
a


large
fortune
in
that
city

left
it
to
found
a
college

within
the


precincts
of
which
no
minister
of
religion
was

on
any
pretext
whatever



to
be
allowed
to
appear

the
stupid
bigotry
of
this
ignorant
millionaire


was
the
high
water
mark
of
french
republican
liberality
during
the


dismal
orgie
of
the
first
republic

it
is
still
the
high
water
mark
of


french
republican
liberality
under
the
third
republic

the
dream
and


desire
of
m

ferry
and
his
friends
are
to
prohibit
ministers
of
religion


from
taking
any
part
whatever
in
the
education
of
the
french
people



already
the
municipal
council
of
paris
has
undertaken
to

bowdlerise



the
literature
of
the
world
in
order
to
prevent
the
minds
of
the
young


from
being
perverted
by
coming
into
contact
with
the
name
of
god

these


good
butchers
and
bakers
and
candlestick
makers
of
the
seine
really


believe

like
certain
more
academical
persons
of
higher
social


pretensions
in
england
and
america

that
the
ineffable
simpletons
and


scoundrels
who
for
three
or
four
years
during
the
last
decade
of
the


last
century
made
ducks
and
drakes
at
paris
of
the
public
fortune
and


the
private
rights
of
the
french
people

were
inspired
harbingers
of
a


new
era

outside
of
france
it
may
be
hard
to
suppose
this
possible

but


nothing
can
be
more
certain
than
that
the
educational
legislation
of


france
since

has
been
aimed
steadily
and
directly
at
the
abolition



not
of
christianity
alone

but
of
all
religion






it
is
curious
to
see
the
common
school
system
of
new
england

which
in


the
beginning
was
the
device
of
a
theocracy
bent
on
usurping
the


authority
of
parents
over
their
children

taken
up
after
more
than
two


hundred
years

and
readjusted
to
the
purposes
of
a
set
of
men
whom
the


puritans
would
have
unhesitatingly
whipped
to
death
at
the
cart
s
tail


as
blasphemers






only
the
other
day

in
the
chamber

an
ardent
republican
member

m



pichon

made
a
speech
in
which
he
openly
avowed
the
object
of
laicising


the
schools
to
be
the
destruction
of
religion


between
you

the


catholics


he
exclaimed


and
us

who
are
republicans

there
is
a
great


abyss

the
interests
of
the
church
are
incompatible
with
those
of
the


republican
government


that
the
republicans
in
the
assembly
should
have


applauded
this
declaration
is
rather
astonishing

since
it
was
in


substance
an
admission
that
the
interests
of
the

republican
government



are
inconsistent
with
those
of
an
admittedly
immense
majority
of
the


french
people

but
they
did
applaud
it

and
not
long
before
m

pichon


made
the
speech
a
solid
republican
vote
of

members
had
been
recorded


for
the
suppression
of
the
french
embassy
to
the
vatican

is
it


surprising
that
the
catholics
of
france
should
be
asking
themselves
all


over
the
country
whether
it
is
possible
for
them
to
accept
the
republic


without
abjuring
their
religion






the

abyss

of
which
m

pichon
speaks
has
been
dug

not
by
the
church



but
by
the
theorists
who
have
expelled
the
sisters
of
charity
from
the


hospitals
and
the
chaplains
from
the
prisons
of
france

who
refuse
to


the
poor
the
right
to
pray
in
the
almshouses

and
who
throw
the


crucifix
out
of
school
houses
which
are
maintained
by
the
money
of


catholic
taxpayers

as
between
m

pichon
and
m

ferry
and
their


fellow
conspirators
on
one
side
of
this
abyss

and
the
marist
brethren


and
the
little
children
of
france
on
the
other
side
of
it

the
history


of
the
world
hardly
encourages
the
belief
that
it
is
the
marist
brethren


and
the
little
children
who
will
finally
be
engulfed






it
is
a
notable
proof
of
the
hold
which
catholic
ideas
have
upon
the


people
in
this
part
of
france

that
notwithstanding
a
marked
tendency
to


emigration
among
the
peasantry
of
the
boulonnais
and
of
artois

the


population
has
steadily
increased
through
the
excess
of
births
over


deaths

this
is
not
true
of
france
as
a
whole

on
the
contrary

while


the
deaths
in
france
in

were



against
an
annual
average
of




from

to


the
births
diminished
from
an
annual
average


of


between

and

to


in


leaving
the
small


excess
of


over
the
deaths

of
these
only


were
of
french


parentage

in
artois
and
the
boulonnais

the
population
is
more
dense


than
in
any
other
part
of
france

excepting
the
metropolitan
regions



while
france

as
a
whole

in


gave
an
average
of
seventy


inhabitants
to
the
square
kilometre

which
is
the
precise
proportion
in


bavaria

the
arrondissement
of
bethune
in
the
coal
mining
country
of


artois

fed
by
an
exceptional
immigration
from
belgium

gave

to
the


square
kilometre

which
exceeds
the
proportion
in
any
division
of
the


german
empire
except
saxony

luebeck

bremen

and
hamburg






the
department
of
the
pas
de
calais

as
a
whole

gave

inhabitants
to


the
square
kilometre

which
is
the
precise
proportion
in
saxe
altenburg



and
exceeds
by
five
the
proportion
in
the
british
islands
taken
as
a


whole

in
the
arrondissement
of
st

omer
the
rate
of
increase
by
natural


growth
some
years
ago
outran
that
of
the
older
sea
board
states
of
the


american
union






this
phenomenon
cannot
be
explained
by
the
improvidence
of
the


artesians

for
they
are
admittedly
remarkable

even
in
france

for


their
frugality
and
their
forecasting
habit
of
mind

a
friend
of
mine



who
lives
near
st

omer

is
probably
right
when
he
attributes
it
to


their
strong
domestic
tastes
and
habits

and
to
the
influence
over
them


of
their
religion

he
says
they
are

fanatics
of
the
family


certainly


in
the
cottages
the
children
seem
to
have
things
all
their
own
way



almost
as
much
as
in
america


the
artesian
parents


my
friend
tells


me


make
their
children
the
objects
of
their
lives


in
the
rural


regions
there
is
not
much
immorality

concubinage

which
is
by
no
means


uncommon
in
the
towns

is
exceedingly
uncommon
in
the
country
of
artois






the
agricultural
artesian
wishes
to
be
the
recognised
head
of
his
house



hates
to
have
things
at
loose
ends

and
habitually
makes
his
wife
a


consulting
partner
in
all
his
affairs

even
when
he
is
not
particularly


devout
he
likes
to
be
on
good
terms
with

his
curate

and
has
very


positive
ideas
as
to
what
is
decent
and
becoming


in
short


said
my


friend


he
is
an
ideal
husbandman
in
every
sense
of
that
english
word



for
which
we
have
no
equivalent

the
assize
records
show
that
offences


against
public
morality
are
almost
wholly
confined
to
the
towns
in


artois

and
it
is
a
notable
fact
that
these
particular
offences
are
much


more
frequently
committed
by
persons
who
can
read
and
write
than
by
the


illiterate







my
friend
seemed
to
be
startled
when
i
told
him
that
this

notable
fact



appeared
to
me
to
be
quite
in
accordance
with
the
nature
of
things

as


set
forth
in
the
sound
old
maxim
cited
by
the
apostle

that

evil


communications
corrupt
good
manners


so
long
as
thirty
years
ago

the


american
census
showed
that
in
the
six
new
england
states

in
which
the


proportion
of
illiterate
native
americans
to
the
native
white


population
was

to


the
proportion
to
the
native
white
population


of
native
white
criminals
was

to



whereas

in
the
six
southern


states
of
delaware

maryland

virginia

georgia

and
the
two
carolinas



the
proportion
of
native
white
illiterates
being

to

of
the
native


white
population

the
proportion
of
native
white
criminals
to
the
native


white
population
was
only

to



mr

montgomery
of
california



assistant
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
in
the
administration
of


president
cleveland

working
on
the
lines
of
inquiry
suggested
by
such


facts
as
these

did
not
hesitate

two
years
ago

to
assert
that

the


boasted
new
england
public
school
system

as
now
by
law
established


throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
american
republic

is
a


poisonous
fountain
fraught
with
the
seeds
of
human
misery
and
moral


death


he
cites
the
official
statistics
given
by
a
new
england


professor

mr

royce

to
prove
that

there
is
hardly
a
state
or
country


in
the
civilised
world

where
atrocious
and
flagrant
crimes
are
so


common
as
in
educated
massachusetts


and
he
shows
that
the
alarming
and


unquestionable
increase
of
crime
in
the
united
states
cannot
be


attributed

as
it
too
often
is

to
the

foreign
element
in
american


society

the
criminal
rate
of
which
has
remained
the
same
or
even


lessened

while
the
native
criminals
increased
during



from




to




during
that
decade
the
total
population
of
the
united


states
increased
from



to




deducting



for


the
increase
by
immigration

we
have
a
general
increase
of



in


the
native
american
population

or
of
less
than

per
cent

against
an


increase
of
about

per
cent

in
the
number
of
native
white
criminals



it
is
no
part
of
my
present
purpose
to
discuss
mr

montgomery
s


contention

but
it
seems
to
me
to
deserve
grave
consideration
in


connection
with
the
adventure
to
which
the
french
republican
government


has
committed
itself

of
suddenly
substituting
for
the
religious
and


parental
system
of
education
in
france

a
french
modification

in
the


interest
of
unbelief

of
that
american
public
school
system
which

as


mr

montgomery
maintains

rests
upon
the
principle

that
the
whole


people
must
be
educated
to
a
certain
degree
at
the
public
expense



irrespectively
of
any
social
distinctions







i
have
already
said
that
st

omer
appears
to
be
in
its
politics


decidedly
republican

an
odd
illustration
of
this
i
found
in
a
hot
local


controversy
waging
there
over
the
setting
up
of
a
statue
in
one
of
the


public
squares

to
commemorate
the
courage
and
patriotism
of
a
local


heroine

jacqueline
robins

this
statue

which

as
a
work
of
art
is
not


unworthy
to
be
compared
with
the
statue
of
jeanne
hachette
at
beauvais



was
set
up

with
much
ceremony

in


i
believe
the
state
paid
for


it


and
stands
upon
a
pedestal

with
an
inscription
setting
forth
how


jacqueline
robins

in
the
year


saved
the
besieged
city
of
st

omer


by
going
off
herself
with
a
train
of
boats
down
the
aa
to
dunkirk

and


bringing
back
the
provisions
and
munitions
of
war
necessary
for
the


defence
of
the
city






as
the
city
of
st

omer
was
certainly
not
besieged
in


this


inscription
naturally
excited
the
critical
indignation
of
the
local


antiquaries

and
on
july




an
exceedingly
clear
and
conclusive


report
on
the
subject
was
laid
before
the
society
of
antiquaries
of


morinia

a
body
which
has
done
good
service
to
the
cause
of
history
in


northern
france

from
this
report
it
plainly
appears
that
st

omer
was


not
besieged
at
all
in


prince
eugene

who
marched
into
artois
with


the
duke
of
marlborough
in
that
year
in
pursuit
of
villars

wished
to


attack
st

omer
after
the
fall
of
douai
and
bethune

but
the


states
general
of
holland
would
not
hear
of
it

and
the
gallant
defence


made
of
aire
sur
la
lys
by
the
marquis
de
goesbriant
kept
the
allies
at


bay
so
late
in
the
year
that
no
attempt
upon
st

omer
could
be
made

the


local
chronicles
rejoice
over
this
escape

particularly

because
they


say
the
duke
of
marlborough
had
vowed
special
vengeance
against
the


city

its
authorities
having
refused
to
oblige
him
by
getting
out
of
the


english
jesuits

college
and
sending
him
certain
papers
which
the


duchess
of
hamilton

the
wife
of
the
brilliant
duke
who
was
killed
in


hyde
park
by
lord
mohun
and
general
macartney

desired
him
to
procure


for
her
use
in
a
law
suit
against

lord
bromley




st

omer

then

not


having
been
besieged
in


why
should
a
statue
be
set
up
in
honour
of


an
audomaraise
dame
for
delivering
it

on
this
point
the
report
of
the


society
of
antiquaries
throws
a
sufficient
and
interesting
light

it


seems
that
there
really
lived
in
st

omer
in

a
certain
dame


jacqueline
isabelle
robins

obviously
a
woman
of
mark
and
force

since


she
carried
on
a
number
of
thriving
industries

and
among
them
the


management

under
a
contract

of
the
boats
between
st

omer

calais

and


dunkirk

napoleon
would
have
thought
her
much
superior
to
madame
de


stael

for
before
she
was
forty
years
old
she
had
married
three


husbands

and
surrounded
herself
with
six
or
seven
flourishing
olive


branches

she
was
constantly
in
the
law
courts
fighting
for
her
rights



not
against
private
persons
only

but
against
the

mayor
and
echevins
of


the
city
of
st

omer


though
st

omer

as
i
have
said

was
not
besieged


by
the
allies

it
was
constantly
occupied
by
the
troops
of
his
most


christian
majesty

who
gave
the
magistrates
and
the
people
almost
as


much
trouble
as
if
they
had
been
enemies

and
the
records
show
that
not


long
before
the
surrender
of
aire
sur
la
lys
to
the
allies
in
november




the
comte
d
estaing

an
ancestor
of
the
admiral
who
did
such
good


service
to
the
american
cause


under
orders
from
versailles
succeeded


in
bringing
to
st

omer
from
dunkirk
a
complete
supply
of
powder
and


other
munitions
of
war

it
seems
to
be
likely
enough
that
in
this


operation
the
military
authorities
availed
themselves
of
the
services
of


dame
jacqueline
and
of
her
boats

as
she
was
a
masterful
dame

and



burying
her
third
husband

who
was
twelve
years
her
junior

in




lived
on
to
depart
at
the
age
of
seventy
five
in


a
local
legend


evidently
grew
up
about
her
personal
share
in
the
events
of
the
great


war
of


the
first
official
historian
of
st

omer

a
worthy
priest


dom
devienne

writing
in


gave
this
legend
form

as
he
transformed


jacqueline
from
a
rich
and
prosperous
woman
of
affairs
into
a

woman
of


the
dregs
of
the
people


calling
her
jane

by
the
way

instead
of


jacqueline

she
became

after
the
revolution

a
popular
heroine

her


third
husband

who
appears
to
have
been
a
young
squire
de
boyaval
and
a


dashing
grey
mousquetaire
of
king
louis

was
metamorphosed
into
a


brewer
s
apprentice

jacqueline
among
her
other
possessions
owned
a


brewery


and
now

in
the
year

we
have
the
thrifty
dame
who
helped


the
king
s
officers
carry
out
the
king
s
orders
for
the
supplying
of


st

omer

immortalised
in
bronze
as
an
audomaraise
jeanne
hachette
or


maid
of
saragossa













this
is
a
curious
sidelight
on
english
political
history


lord






bromley

was
obviously
sir
william
bromley

m
p


the
bitter
enemy






of
marlborough

who
earned
the
undying
hatred
of
the
duchess
by






comparing
her
to
alice
perrers

the
mistress
of
edward
iii

in







harley
prevented
the
election
of
bromley
as
speaker
by
re
publishing






an
account
of
the

grand
toure

written
by
him

and
foisting
into
it






notes
intended
to
show
that
bromley
was
a

papist


bromley
was






again
a
candidate
for
the
same
office
in


and
marlborough






evidently
hoped
to
get
from
st

omer
documentary
proof
of
the







papistry

of
his
foe

the
second
duchess
of
hamilton
came

i
think







of
a
catholic
family

and
may
have
thought
she
had
a
clue
to
these






documents

the
intrigue

however

failed

and
bromley
was
elected






speaker
without
opposition
in
november








is
not
this
worthy
to
stand
on
record
with
sir
roger
de
coverley
s
tale


of
the
old
coachman
who
had
a
monument
in
westminster
abbey
because
he


figured
on
the
box
of
the
coach
in
which
thomas
thynne
of
longleat
was


barbarously
murdered
by
count
konigsmark






the
republican
mayor
of
st

omer
took
sides
on
the
question
of


jacqueline
robins
in

with
the
republican

professor
of
history
in


the
lyceum


both
of
them
being

officers
of
the
academy


against
the


society
of
antiquaries

and
i
dare
say
the
matter
may
affect
the


parliamentary
elections
in
september

















chapter
iii





in
the
pas
de
calais


continued











aire
sur
la
lys





it
is
a
local
tradition
at
aire
sur
la
lys
that

about
half
a
century


ago

the
good
people
of
this
ancient
and
picturesque
town

which

like


st

omer

remained
a
part
of
the
spanish
dominions
when
all
the
rest
of


the
artois
became
french
by
the
treaty
of
the
pyrenees
in


turned


out
with
flags
and
music
to
welcome
their
mayor
back
from
paris



bringing
the
good
news
that
the
projected
northern
railway
should
not


pass
through
their
territory

to
disturb
their
settled
trade






this
unique
incident
is
often
cited
to
show
the
tenacious
conservatism


of
the
artesians

i
believe

however

it
only
proves
that
the
people
of


aire

dwelling
in
a
region
which
has
been
fought
over
from
time


immemorial

had
a
well
grounded
objection
to
the
exclusively
military


views
with
which
marshal
soult
then
desired
that
the
government
of
louis


philippe
should
take
up
and
carry
out
the
projected
enterprise






at
all
events

aire
sur
la
lys
now
rejoices
in
a
comfortable
little


railway
station

which
makes
it
an
important
point
in
the
system
of
the


northern
railway
of
france






there

on
a
lovely
evening
in
june

i
found
the
carriage
of
m

labitte



one
of
the
councillors
general
of
the
department

waiting
to
take
me
to


his
charming
and
hospitable
home
in
the
richly
cultivated
agricultural


commune
of
st

quentin






it
was
on
the
eve
of
pentecost
when

as
the
german
poet
tells
us


the


woods
and
fields
put
off
all
sadness


and
a
lovelier
summer
evening
it


would
be
hard
to
find
even
in
england






m

labitte
is
a
conservative
and
a
devout
catholic

as
i
have
already


mentioned

he
was
a
candidate
in
the
pas
de
calais
in

for
the
seat


in
the
chamber
now
held
by
m

camescasse

and
received


votes


against


for
his
opponent

in
aire
he
was
beaten
by
only

votes


out
of
a
total
of



his
influence
in
the
country
here
is

in
a


certain
sense

hereditary

for
he
came
of
a
family
which
in
the
last


century
gave
many
excellent
ecclesiastics
to
the
service
of
the
church



among
a
population
then

as
now

remarkable
for
its
strong
religious


feeling

when
the
states
general
were
convened
by
louis
xvi

a
century


ago

the
first
date
fixed
for
the
elections
in
artois
had
to
be


postponed

at
the
request
of
the
duc
de
guines

because
it
interfered


with
easter

the
artesians
cared
more
for
the
church
than
for
the
state



yet

in
no
part
of
france
was
the
calling
of
the
states
general
more


popular

and
nowhere
were
more
efforts
made
before

than
in
artois


to
improve
the
condition
of
the
people
and
to
secure
a
more
just
and


liberal
fiscal
administration

the
clergy
were
extraordinarily
powerful


in
artois

alike
by
reason
of
their
property
and
of
the
religious


disposition
of
the
people

and
it
is
a
curious
and
interesting
fact
that


under
the
constitution
of
the
estates
of
artois
it
was
established



thanks
to
the
union
of
the
clergy
with
the
third
estate

that

while
no


votes
of
the
nobility
and
the
clergy
united
should
bind
the
third


estate

any
joint
vote
of
the
third
estate
with
either
of
the
other
two


orders
should
bind
them
all

here

long
before
the
much
bewritten
date


of


we
have
the
church
in
artois
arraying
itself
on
the
side
of
the


tax
paying
people
against
the
privileged
classes

modern
inquiries
show



indeed

that
this
was
the
attitude
of
the
great
body
of
the
french


clergy
long
before
what
is
called
the

revolution


the
majority
of
the


representatives
of
the
clergy
in
the
states
general
of

did
not
wait


for
the
theatrical
demonstrations
in
the
tennis
court
of
versailles



about
which
so
much
nonsense
has
been
talked
and
written

to
join
the


third
estate
in
insisting
upon
a
real
reform
of
the
public
service

no


french
historian
has
ventured
to
make
such
a
picture
of
the
catholic


clergy
of
france
under
the
bourbons
as
lord
macaulay
thought
himself


authorised
to
paint
of
the
protestant
clergy
of
england
under
the


stuarts

there
were
flagrant
scandals
among
the
higher
orders
of
the


church
in
france

no
doubt

as
there
were
in
england

the
names
of


dubois

of
lomenie
de
brienne

of
de
rohan
are
not
associated
with
the


cardinal
virtues

de
jarente

bishop
of
orleans

driving
mdlle

guimard


to
the
opera
in
his
coronetted
and
mitred
coach

is
not
an
edifying


figure

nor
is
louis
de
grimaldi

bishop
of
mans

saying
mass
in
his
red


hunting
coat
and
breeches

but
the
protestant
dean
of
st

patrick
s


thought
the
execution
for
felony
of
another
protestant
dean
a
capital


theme
for
a
merry
ballad

and
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century


arthur
young
painted
the
english
rural
clergy
in
very
dark
colours

the


curates

the
rectors

the
monks
of
france
as
a
body

showed
under
the


old
regime
the
same
qualities
of
devout
faith
and
christian
sympathy


with
the
people
with
which
they
met
and
baffled
their
persecutors
after


the
crash
of
the
monarchy

the
three
representatives
of
the
clergy
who


first
struck
hands
with
the
third
estate
on
june




were
curates


sent
to
paris
by
a
province
more
intensely
catholic
than
artois

they


were
poitevin
priests
from
the
region
which
we
now
know
as
la
vendee



and
which
only
four
years
afterwards
rose
in
arms
to
defend
its
altars


and
its
homes
against
the
intolerable
despotism
of
the

patriots

of


paris






when
turgot
was
put
in
charge
of
that
work
of
fiscal
reform
which
might


have
spared
france
the
horrors
and
the
disasters
of
the
revolution

had


louis
xvi

been
capable
of
standing
even
by
turgot
to
the
end

he


carried
on
an
extensive
correspondence
with
curates
in
artois
as
well
as


in
the
other
provinces
of
france

as
the
best
means
of
educating
the


people
to
an
intelligent
appreciation
of
his
purposes
and
of
his
plans



condorcet

who
treated
the
brutal
murderers
of
the
duc
de
la


rochefoucauld
with
a
complaisance
which
entitles
him
to
the
confidence


of
the
most
advanced
anti
clerical
philosophers
of
our
own
day

bears


witness
to
the
good
intentions
of
turgot
s
correspondents

he
says

in


his
memoir
of
turgot

printed
at
philadelphia
seven
years
before
the


revolution
of



that

the
curates

accustomed
to
preach
sound
morals



to
appease
the
quarrels
of
the
people

and
to
encourage
peace
and


concord

were
in
a
better
position
than
any
other
men
in
france
to


prepare
the
minds
of
the
people
for
the
good
work
it
was
the
intents
of


the
ministers
to
do







what
was
true
of
the
french
curates
a
hundred
years
ago
is
true
of
them


to
day

the
duties
prescribed
to
them
by
the
church
being
still


precisely
what
they
were
when
condorcet
bore
this
testimony
to
the
good


dispositions
of
men
much
more
conscientious
than
himself

then

too

as


now

the
curates
were
required
to
look
carefully
after
the
education
of


the
children
in
their
parishes

france
is
indebted

not
to
the


revolution

but
to
a
great
protestant
historian
and
statesman

guizot



and
to
king
louis
philippe
for
the
foundation
of
her
system
of
public


education

the
revolutionists
of

left
the
country
worse
off
in
this


matter
than
they
found
it

the
royal
ordinance
of
louis
xiv

in




which
required
the
establishment
of
schoolmasters
and
schoolmistresses


in
every
parish
in
which
they
were
not
then
to
be
found

and
fixed
the


salaries
to
be
paid
these
masters
and
mistresses
out
of
a
public
tax
in


every
parish
in
which
no
foundations
for
their
support
existed

was


distinctly
a
public
school
law

this
ordinance
made
it
incumbent
upon


all
parents
and
other
persons
who
had
charge
of
children
to
send
them
to


the
schools
until
they
were
fourteen
years
of
age

and
it
also
enjoined


upon
the
curates
the
duty
of

watching
with
particular
attention
over


the
education
of
the
children
in
their
respective
parishes


the
spirit


in
which
the
clergy
of
artois

at
least

discharged
this
duty
appears
in


an
ordinance
of
the
bishop
of
arras
issued
in


half
a
century


before
the
revolution
of


in
which
the
bishop
lays
it
down
as
a


maxim
that

the
greatest
charity
which
can
be
shown
the
poor
is
to


ensure
them
the
means
of
obtaining
an
education







this

down
to
thirty

was
the
principle
of
legislation
in


virginia
upon
the
public
school
question

the
state
not
attempting
to


interfere
with
the
authority
of
parents
over
their
children
in
the


matter
of
education

but
making
an
appropriation
for
the
instruction
of


the
children
of
the
poor

that
mischievous
wind
bag
lakanal
lived
in


mississippi
and
louisiana
during
his
exile
in
america

and
it
is


possible
that
his
influence
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
the
early


adoption
by
another
southern
state

louisiana

of
the
general
public


school
system

however
that
may
be

louisiana
in

spent
upon
her


public
schools
three
times
as
much
money
annually
as
any
of
the
new


england
states

with
the
result
that

out
of
a
native
white
population


of



she
had
in
her
prisons

native
white
criminals

or

in



of
the
whole
number

being

the
largest
proportion
of
criminals
to


population
at
that
time
to
be
found
in
america

if
not
in
the
world




virginia

out
of
a
native
white
population
of



in


had
no


more
than

native
white
criminals
in
her
prisons

or

in


of


her
native
white
population






it
is
a
curious
fact

by
the
way

that
but
for
the
fidelity
of
the


french
clergy
before


in
carrying
out
the
work
imposed
upon
them
by


the
ordinance
of
louis
xiv


and
commended
in
the
ordinance
of
the


bishop
of
arras
in


two
of
the
most
conspicuous
actors
in
the


grotesquely
horrible
drama
of
the
french
revolution
would
have
starved


to
death
in
the
streets
of
arras

or
grown
up
there
in
vagabondage

the


clergy
of
st

vaast
in
the
diocese
of
arras
found

in


two
wretched


urchins
thrown
upon
the
world
by
an
unnatural
father

one
of
these



maximilian
isidore
de
robespierre

was
born
in


the
other

augustus


bai
joseph
de
robespierre

in


the
good
priests
picked
them
up



cared
for
them

and
put
them
in
the
way
of
getting
a
good
education



which
they
turned
to
such
purpose
that
both
of
them
eventually
came
to


the
guillotine
in
the
flower
of
their
years

and
amid
the
cordially


contemptuous
execrations
of
decent
people
all
over
the
world

one
of
the


most
accomplished
public
men
in
massachusetts
told
me
years
ago

that
he


was
stopped
on
his
way
to
school
one
morning
in


by
a
friend
of
the


family

who
bade
him
run
back
at
once
and
tell
his
father
the
news
had


come
from
europe
that

the
head
of
robert
spear
had
been
cut
off



make


haste


said
this
gentleman


and
your
papa
will
give
you
a
silver


dollar

he
will
be
so
glad
to
hear
it







it
was
rather
instructive
to
think
of
the

sea
green
incorruptible

and


his
idiotic

feast
of
the
supreme
being

on
that
beautiful
clay
of


pentecost

in
the
charming
rural
commune
of
st

quentin

the
peace
and


happiness
of
which
was
for
a
time
so
cruelly
broken
up
by
his
atrocities


and
follies
a
hundred
years
ago

the
fine
old
church

near
by
my
host
s


residence

has
been
restored
with
great
taste
and
good
sense

it
was


crowded
at
early
mass
with
the
farmers
and
their
families

many
of
the


men
wearing
their
blouses

but
all
well
to
do

for
this
region
is
one
of


the
richest
and
best
cultivated
districts
of
northern
france

the


service
was
celebrated
with
much
simplicity

but
with
no
lack
of
due


ceremony

the
singing
was
excellent

and
the
priest
s
homily

a
brief


and
very
good
discourse
on
the
spirit
of
christian
charity

was
listened


to
with
great
attention






the
pretty
custom
prevails
here

as
in
normandy

of
handing
about
in
the


congregation

at
a
certain
point
in
the
service

a
basket
of
bread

two


gravely
courteous
old
peasants
presented
the
baskets
in
turn
to
all
the


people

the
service
over

the
farmers
stood
and
chatted
together
in


groups
in
the
churchyard
and
about
the
porch

and
i
heard
much
talk
of


the
outlook
for
the
crops

of
the
price
of
cattle

and
of
certain


properties
which
had
recently
changed
hands

of
politics
next
to


nothing






my
host
was
for
many
years
a
notary
at
aire

he
has
transferred
this


position
now
to
the
husband
of
his
only
daughter

and
occupies
himself


mainly
with
his
agricultural
interests

the
notary

who
is
a
personage


everywhere
in
france

is
especially
a
personage
in
artois

this
has
come


about
in
part
through
the
great
changes
which
have
taken
place
in
the


proprietorship
of
land
in
this
province
during
the
last
three
centuries



towards
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century

after
the
province
was


substantially
united
with
france
by
louis
xiv


great
numbers
of
small


proprietors

who
had
done
well
enough
under
the
spanish
rule

found


themselves
forced

by
the
pressure
of
taxation

to
part
with
their


land

and
there
was
a
marked
increase
in
the
great
estates

not
only
of


the
clergy
but
of
the
laity

after
the
first
consul
took
the
country
in


hand

and
began
to
reorganise
it
socially

on
the
principle
laid
down
by


him
so
often
and
so
energetically

in
his
dealings
with
his
councillors



that

true
civil
liberty
in
a
state
depends
upon
the
absolute
safety
of


property


there
began
to
grow
up
in
artois
a
great
middle
class
of


landholders

corresponding
in
many
conditions
to
the

strong
farmers

of


ireland

with
the
increase
of
this
class
came
a
natural
increase
in
the


importance
and
influence
of
the
notaries

already
and
through
the


spanish
traditions
very
considerable
in
this
region

in
many
parts
of


the
province
the
notary
is
recognised
as
an
unofficial

but


authoritative

social
arbiter

to
whom
may
be
safely
referred
for


settlement
all
sorts
of
disputes

including
very
often
questions
of


property
which
would
elsewhere
be
taken
before
the
courts
of
law

it
was


pleasant
to
see
that
the
relation
thus
established
between
m

labitte


and
the
people
generally
had
not
been
affected
by
the
political


agitation
of
the
last
ten
years

when
i
drove
about
the
country
with


him

i
observed
that
he
was
saluted
everywhere
in
the
friendliest


fashion

and
that

as
he
more
than
once
told
me

by
persons
politically


quite
hostile
to
his
re
election
as
councillor
general






after
luncheon
on
pentecost

a
most
interesting
ceremony
took
place
at


st

quentin

a
long
procession
made
up
of
the
inhabitants
of
the


commune

the
men
wearing
their
best
clothes

the
young
girls
garlanded


and
dressed
in
white

set
forth
from
the
porch
of
the
church

after
a


brief
service
there

and
marched
around
the
commune

it
was
the
english


beating
of
the
bounds
without
the
beating

and
with
the
old
religious


rites

in
the
midst
of
the
procession

which
extended
perhaps
a
quarter


of
a
mile

the
parish
priest
walked
alone
under
an
embroidered
canopy


borne
up
by
young
villagers

acolytes

with
lighted
candles

moved
on


either
side
of
the
canopy

before
it
was
borne
a
white
silk
banner
of


the
virgin

and
behind
it
a
banner
embroidered
in
gold

all
the
park
and


grounds
of
m

labitte
lying
within
the
commune

and
being
thrown
open
to


the
people

a
very
beautiful
altar
of
verdure
and
roses
had
been
set
up


under
a
bower
in
the
great
garden
behind
the
house

by
the
daughter
of


m

labitte

before
this
altar
the
procession
paused

a
brief
service
was


performed
there

and
then
the
long
line
resumed
its
march

a
chorus
of


some
twenty
male
voices
chanting

as
it
went

the
magnificat

nothing


could
exceed
the
unaffected
simplicity
and
seriousness
of
the
people
of


both
sexes
and
of
all
ages

the
day
was
one
of
those
perfect
days



which

as
mr

lowell
says

come
to
the
world
in
june

if
ever
they
come


at
all

and
as
the
long
line
wound
its
way
around
the
fields

green
with


the
prospering
crops

beneath
the
orchards
and
the
groves

and
between


the
fragrant
hedgerows

the
silvery
chiming
of
the
bells
in
the
old


church
alternated
with
the
far
off
chanting
of
the
choristers

and
the


fitful
breeze
brought
us

from
time
to
time

the
grave
deep
voice
of
the


priest
reciting

as
he
moved

the
ancient
prayers
of
hope
and
of


thanksgiving






it
was
interesting
to
remember
that
under
the
first
french
attempt
at
a


republic

this
lovely
rural
spectacle
would
have
been
as
impossible
as


it
would
be
to
day
under
the
rule
of
the
mahdi
in
the
soudan

and
also



to
reflect
that
france
is
governed
to
day
by
men
who
dream
of
making
it


thus
impossible
once
more

my
host
at
st

quentin
being
a
councillor
general

his
term
of
office


expires
with
the
elections
fixed
to
take
place
on
july


there
is
no


reason
in
the
nature
of
things
why
councillors
general
should
be
elected


on
the
same
lines
with
deputies
and
senators

on
the
contrary

it
would


seem
to
be
very
desirable
that
local
rather
than
national
considerations


should
govern
the
election
of
such
functionaries

but
it
has
been
found


difficult

even
in
england
and
wales

to
keep
national
party
politics


out
of
the
election
of
the
new
county
councillors

whose
duties
are


modelled
in
some
important
respects
upon
those
assigned
to
the


councillors
general
in
france

and
it
is
evident
that
the
french
local


elections
in
july
will
be
largely
determined
by
considerations
affecting


the
national
elections
which
must
take
place
in
september
and
october



m

labitte

who
was
elected
a
councillor
general
by
the
conservatives
in


this
department
six
years
ago

was
defeated
in


as
i
have
already


said

in
a
by
election

held
to
fill
a
vacancy
in
the
chamber
of


deputies

it
is
the
wish
of
his
party
friends
that
he
should
offer


himself
as
a
candidate
for
re
election
as
a
councillor
general
on
july




but
he
does
not
seem
disposed
to
do
this

preferring

i
think

to


keep
himself
quite
free
to
do
his
very
best
to
bring
about
a


conservative
victory
in
the
national
elections
in
september

with
the


importance
of
which
to
the
future
of
france
he
is
deeply
impressed



meanwhile

he
is
giving
a
personal
account
of
his
stewardship
as
a


councillor
general
to
his
constituents
in
a
series
of

conferences


one


of
these
conferences
he
was
good
enough
to
invite
me
to
attend






it
was
held
in
a
commune

distant
some
ten
or
twelve
miles
from


st

quentin
par
aire

and

as
the
custom
of
france
is

it
was
held
on
a


sunday
afternoon

m

labitte
s
son
in
law
drove
out
from
aire
with
his


wife
to
dine
and
spend
the
evening
with
us

and
about
three
o
clock
m



labitte

his
son
in
law

and
myself
set
out
for
the
conference

our
road


lay
through
a
level
but
richly
cultivated
and

in
its
way

very


beautiful
region

in
the
last
century

artois
seems
to
have
been
a
kind


of
ireland

the
climate
was
excessively
damp

the
lack
of
forests
and


the
undeveloped
coal
mines
left
the
peasantry
dependent
upon
turf
and


peat
for
fuel

the
roads
were
few
and
bad

there
were
good
crops
of


grain

but
the
intendant
bignon

drawing
up
a
report
on
the
province
at


the
close
of
the
seventeenth
century

for
the
duke
of
burgundy

tells
us


the
wars
had
made
an
end
of
all
the
manufactures

including
the


long
famous
tapestry
works
of
arras


there
were
few
fruit
trees

little


hay

and
little
manure


here
and
there
some
linen
was
made

but
the


trade
of
the
province
was
carried
on
almost
exclusively
in
grain

hops



flax

and
wool

iron
and
copper
utensils

and
coal
and
slates
came
to


artois
from
flanders

cod
fish
and
cheese
from
the
low
countries

butter


and
all
kinds
of
manufactured
goods
from
england

yet
the
population


steadily
increased
all
through
the
eighteenth
century

while
it
was


falling
off
in
the
neighbouring
provinces
of
france

the
worthy


intendant
thought
the
people
sadly
wanting
in

intelligence

activity



and
practical
sense


and
seems
indeed

like
a
malthusian
before


malthus

half
inclined
to
attribute
the
phenomena
of
increase
and


multiplication
in
artois
to
these
defects

it
would
surprise
him

i


fancy

to
look
on
the
people
and
the
land
of
artois
to
day

the
land
has


become
one
of
the
most
fertile
and
prosperous
regions
of
france

the


people

unaffected
to
any
appreciable
extent
by
immigration

and


unchanged
alike
in
race
and
in
religion

increase
and
multiply
as
of


old

the
well
tilled
fields

the
well
kept
and
beautiful
roads

the


neat

green
hedgerows

the
orchards
bear
witness
on
every
side
to
the


intelligence

the
activity

the
practical
sense
of
the
inhabitants






m

baudrillart
in
one
of
his
invaluable
treatises
on
the
condition
of


france
before
the
revolution
of


gives
us
the
main
key
of
this


great
difference
between
the
condition
of
agricultural
artois
in
the


eighteenth
century
and
its
condition
to
day

he
cites
a
most
curious


appeal
to
the
estates
of
artois
in
behalf
of
the
rural
populations

from


which
it
appears
that
the
citizens
of
the
chief
towns
had
combined
with


the

noblesse

and
the
higher
clergy
to
keep
the
village
curates
and
the


farmers
out
of
the
provincial
assemblies

and
to
throw
the
whole
burden


of
taxation
upon
the
agriculturists


the
soil
of
artois


say
the


authors
of
this
appeal


is
quite
as
good
as
the
soil
of
england

and


yet
the
artesian
farmers
can
only
get
out
of
their
labour
on
it
one


quarter
as
much
as
the
english
do


it
was
the
fiscal
maladministration



they
maintain

which
checked
the
progress
of
agriculture
and
depressed


the
condition
of
the
farmers

and
it
is
interesting
to
observe
that


these
rural
reformers
proposed
to
remedy
the
evils
of
which
they


complained

not
by
abolishing
all
the
privileges
of
the
privileged


classes
in
a
night

as
did
the
headlong
mob
of
the
states
general
at


paris
in


but
by
securing
a
fairer
representation
of
the
rural


regions
in
the
provincial
estates

limiting
the
duration
of
the


provincial
parliaments
to
three
years

and
deciding
that
one
third
of


the
seats
should
be
vacated
and
refilled
every
year

this
does
not
look


as
if
the
artesians
of
the
last
century
were
particularly
deficient


either
in
intelligence
or
in
practical
sense






on
our
way
to
the
conference
we
saw
several
sugar
factories

most
of


them
now
abandoned

though
the
beet
crops
of
artois
are
still
very


important

and
my
companions
told
me
that
the
people
here

with
all


their
traditional
conservatism

are
very
quick
to
abandon
any
industry


which
ceases
to
promise
good
returns

and
to
change
their
crops
as
the


conditions
of
the
market
change

we
saw
but
few
chateaux

one
of
the


most
considerable

standing
well
in
view
from
the
road
in
the
midst
of


an
extensive
park

and
approached
by
a
long
avenue
of
well
grown
trees



seemed
to
be
shut
up

the
proprietor

the
count
de





i
was
told
had


not
visited
it
for
two
years
past

one
of
his
gamekeepers
having
been


murdered
in
a
conflict
with
some
poachers






under
the
existing
laws
in
france

political
conferences
must
be
held


within
four
walls

trafalgar
square
meetings
would
be
as
impossible
in


republican
france
as
in
monarchical
germany

as
the
commune
in
which
m



labitte
was
to
meet
his
constituents
possesses
no
convenient
hall

and


the
local
authorities
were
not
particularly
eager
to
facilitate
the


conference

one
of
the
local
conservatives

a
well
to
do
farmer

had


taken
it
upon
himself
to
provide

at
his
own
expense

a
proper
place
of


meeting

by
fitting
up
a
fine
large
barn
with
seats

and
putting
up
a


simple
rustic
platform
in
one
corner
of
it
for
the
speaker

it
struck
me


that
this
was
a
symptom
of
genuine
interest
in
the
politics
of
his


region
not
likely
to
be
shown
in
similar
circumstances
by
many
english


or
american
farmers

he
was
a
man
of
middle
age

with
the
quiet



self
possessed
carriage

general
among
his
class
in
all
parts
of
france



and
received
us

in
the
large
and
neatly
furnished
best
room
of
his


old
fashioned
and
very
comfortable
house

with
frank
and
simple


courtesy

on
the
walls
hung
a
number
of
engravings
and
two
or
three


small
paintings

one
of
these
represented
the
duc
d
orleans

the
father


of
the
comte
de
paris

in
the
uniform
of
the
celebrated
corps
of


chasseurs
which
he
organised
and
to
which
he
gave
his
name


that


picture


said
the
farmer


was
given
to
my
father
by
the
prince

he


used
to
stop
here
often
while
he
was
at
the
camp
of
the
chasseurs

and


take
his
breakfast

i
remember
him
perfectly

for
i
was
then
a


well
grown
lad

and
he
was
always
full
of
kindness
and
good
spirits

ah



if
he
had
lived

we
should
not
be
where
we
are
to
day
in
france

with


all
these
debts
and
all
these
dangers







the
constituents
of
my
host

all
of
them
specially
invited
by
letter
to


attend
the
conference

had
already
begun
to
assemble
when
we
arrived



but
some
of
them
had
two
or
three
miles
to
walk
after
service
in
their


respective
churches

and
it
was
nearly
six
o
clock
when
the
conference


began

by
that
time
the
large
farmyard
and
the
rooms
of
the
house
were


filled
with
a
company
of
perhaps
a
hundred
and
fifty
men

almost
all
of


them
farmers

among
them
was
only
one
landowner
of
the
aristocratic


class

the
comte
de





who
had
walked
over
from
his
chateau
about


three
miles
off

he
was
a
type
of
the
old
fashioned
french
country


gentleman

tall
and
sinewy

with
finely
cut
features

simply

not
to
say


carelessly

dressed

but
with
an
unmistakable
air
of
distinction

and
a


certain
peremptory
courtesy
of
manner
which
would
infallibly
have
got


him
into
trouble
in
the
days
when

near
baume
les
dames

arthur
young


had
to
clear
himself
of
the
suspicion
that
he
was
a
gentleman
on
pain
of


being
promptly
hanged
from
a
lantern
hook






the
seats
in
the
barn
once
filled

some
fifty
auditors
grouped


themselves
in
the
farmyard
about
the
wide
open
doors
of
the
barn

and
m



labitte
mounted
the
extemporised
platform

the
proceedings
had
to
be


suspended
for
a
few
moments
as
the
attention
of
the
audience
was


suddenly
drawn
to
the
high
road
by
the
galloping
past
of
two
generals
in


full
uniform

with
their
staff
officers

from
st

omer

there
was
no


nomination
of
a
chairman
or
a
secretary

none
of
the
inevitable


formalities
of
an
english
or
american
political
gathering

m

labitte


called
the
meeting
to
order
by
the
simple
process
of
beginning
to


address
it

nothing
could
be
more
direct
and
business
like
than
his


speech

it
was
exactly
what
he
told
his
hearers
he
meant
it
to
be

an


account
of
his
stewardship
as
their
councillor
general

he
said
not
a


word
about
the
personal
aspects
of
the
party
conflicts
raging
in
france



and
very
little
about
the
national
aspects
of
that
conflict

speaking
in


a
frank
conversational
way

and
referring
to
his
notes
only
for
figures


and
dates

he
gave
his
constituents
a
succinct
picture
of
the
effect


upon
their
own
local
interests
of
the
policy
pursued
by
the
government


of
the
republic

he
told
them
how
much
of
their
money
had
been
spent


under
the
action
of
the
council
general
during
the
six
years
of
his


term

and
on
what
it
had
been
spent

and
with
what
results

if
they


liked
the
picture

well
and
good

if
not

the
remedy
was
in
their
own


hands
at
the
next
election

he
had
forewarned
me
to
expect
nothing


demonstrative
in
the
attitude
of
his
audience


they
listen
most


attentively


he
said


but
they
give
you
no
sign
either
of
agreement


or
disagreement

of
satisfaction
or
dissatisfaction

at
night

after
the


meeting
is
over

they
will
break
up
into
little
knots
and
coteries

and


talk
it
all
over
among
themselves

if
they
are
pleased
on
the
whole

one


of
the
group
finally
will
say


well

labitte
told
us
the
truth


and


that
being
admitted
by
the
rest

the
conference
will
be
a
success







on
this
occasion
the
auditors
were
much
more
outspoken
during
the


conference

speaking
of
the
unequal
pressure
upon
the
different
communes


of
the
military
service

m

labitte
told
them
a
story
of
a
youth
who


came
to
him
to
get
an
exemption
from
service


i
told
him


said
m



labitte


that
i
should
be
very
glad
to
get
it
for
him

but
that
his


commune
was
not
at
that
moment
entitled
to
an
exemption

and
that
i


could
not
be
a
party
to
putting
an
injustice
upon
another
commune

he


was
annoyed
at
this

and
thought
i
ought
to
do
him
a
favour

no
matter


at
whose
cost

i
declined

and
he
went
away

some
time
after
i
met
him



when
he
exultingly
told
me
that
he
had
seen
one
of
my
colleagues

a


republican

and
had
got
from
him
the
exemption
he
wanted

after
that
i


heard
stories
put
about
to
the
effect
that
labitte
cared
nothing
about


the
pressure
of
the
military
service
on
the
labouring
people

was
i
not


right

was
it
not
my
duty
to
see
no
favouritism
shown
to
one
commune
at


the
expense
of
another







to
these
queries
there
was
a
prompt
and
general
response


yes

yes

you


were
quite
right


and
several
voices
cried
out


bravo


quite
right



labitte







again

in
dealing
with
the
question
of
education

m

labitte
told
his


hearers
of
three
instances
in
which
small
communes
had
been
made
to


expend
sums
inordinately
disproportionate
to
their
resources
upon
what


he
called

scholastic
palaces


although
a
great
majority
of
the
people


in
each
instance
distinctly
refused
to
send
their
children
to
the
lay


schools
established
in
these

palaces


one
case
was
that
of
a
commune


of
some
seven
hundred
souls
compelled
to
expend
more
than
sixty
thousand


francs

or


l


sterling

upon
a

scholastic
palace



i
opposed


these
expenditures


he
said


for
i
think
it
is
part
of
the
duty
of
a


councillor
general
to
look
closely
into
the
use
made
of
your
money







this

also

the
hearers
applauded

not
noisily
at
all

but
with
a
kind


of
gratified
murmur

not
unlike
the
very
loud
purring
of
a
very
large


cat

by
this
time
it
was
evident
that
the
speaker
had
his
audience
well


in
hand

and
m

labitte
took
up
some
points
of
attack
made
on
himself



one
of
these
was
that
he
was
a

clerical


he
said
that
he
certainly
was


a

clerical


if
that
meant
a
man
who
had
a
religion
and
respected
it



and
wished
to
see
the
religion
of
other
people
respected

and
gliding
on


from
this
to
the
question
of
the
religious
education
of
children

he


asked
the
people
whether
they
wished
to
see
the
curates
forbidden
to


teach
their
children
the
principles
of
their
religion

he
was
instantly


answered
by
a
man
standing
in
the
crowd
just
outside
the
door
of
the


barn

who

in
a
loud
and
rather
husky
voice

shouted
out
that

the


priest
had
no
business
in
the
school


several
of
the
audience
met
this


interruption
with
derisive
laughter

and
two
or
three
of
them
sharply


invited
the
man
to
hold
his
tongue
and
go
about
his
business

for
a


moment
it
seemed
as
if
we
were
about
to
have
a
scene

but
m

labitte


interposed

with
perfect
good
temper
he
replied
to
the
man
that
he
was


quite
of
his
opinion
as
to
the
proper
place
of
a
priest

and
that
he
had


no
wish
to
see
the
children
at
school
interfered
with
in
their
school


hours
by
any
instruction
not
a
part
of
the
school
programme

he


suggested

however

that

instead
of
shouting
and
clamouring

the
man


should
wait
till
he

m

labitte

had
got
through

and
then
come
up



amiably
and
prettily

on
the
platform
and
state
his
own
views
as
fully


as
he
liked

this
made
the
man
in
the
doorway
angrier
than
ever

and
as


the
audience
good
naturedly
laughed
at
him

he
began
to
use
rather


abusive
language

upon
this
several
stalwart
peasants
rose
and
made


their
way
towards
him
with
very
plain
intimations
that
if
he
did
not


take
to
the
highway
he
would
be
carried
there

the
uproar
was
all
over


in
five
minutes

some
companions
of
the
anti
clerical
gentleman

not


liking
the
look
of
the
audience

contrived
to
surround
him
and
led
him


off

and
he
disappeared
uttering
a
threat
or
two
of
incoherent
defiance


as
he
went
out
of
the
farmyard

a
burly
farmer
seated
near
me
explained


that

the
fellow
was
drunk

but


he
added


he
was
sent
here
to
do
all


this

and
i
know
who
sent
him

do
you
see
that
high
chimney
across
the


road
some
way
off
among
the
trees

well

he
is
a
factory
hand
there



there
are
a
number
of
them

they
don
t
belong
to
this
country

and
the


manufacturer
is
an
intriguer

he
wanted
to
be
a
councillor
general

and


we
beat
him
off

he
doesn
t
like
it

and
that
s
at
the
bottom
of
it


all







m

labitte
spoke
for
about
an
hour

the
audience
gradually
increasing


and
listening
with
close
attention

at
the
end
the
farmer

who
had


arranged
the
conference

got
up
and
thanked
the
councillor
general
for


the
account
he
had
given
of
his
services

and
then
the
meeting
broke
up


as
quietly
as
it
had
assembled

and
with
as
little
ceremony






before
the
company
began
to
leave
the
barn

a
young
man
near
the
door


asked
for
some
information
as
to
the
duties
likely
to
be
imposed
to


protect
the
farmers

and
getting
a
brief
and
clear
reply

he
said
that


would
be
very
satisfactory

if
only

some
proprietors
would
not
put
such


high
prices
on
their
land


the
count

who
sat
just
in
front
of
me
and


who
had
kept
his
hawk
eye
fixed
on
the
speaker

chuckled
to
himself
and


said
to
me


that
shot
was
meant
for
me







altogether
the
proceedings
gave
me
a
very
favourable
notion
of
the


intelligence
and
the
practical
sense
of
the
people

if
all
the


constituencies
in
france
could
be
handled
in
this
direct
fashion
at
the


national
elections
in
september

the
result
of
those
elections
might
be


at
least
the
approximative
expression
of
the
sense
of
the
nation






but
this
is
not
to
be
expected

there
is
much
more
canvassing
done

i


think

by
legislative
candidates
in
france

and
much
less
public


speaking
than
in
america
or
in
england

and
the
pressure
of
the


government
upon
the
voters
is
very
much
greater
here
even
than
it
is
in


america

the
proportion
of
office
holders
to
the
population
is
much
more


considerable

and
the
recent
governments
have
made
the
tenure
of
office


in
france
even
more
dependent
upon
the
political
activity
of
the


officials
than
it
has
ever
been
in
the
united
states

this
is
one
of
the


many
evil
legacies
of
the
first
republic

the
maxim
that


to
the


victors
belong
the
spoils


i
am
sorry
to
say
has
been
pretty


extensively
reduced
to
practice
on
my
side
of
the
atlantic

but
it
was


first
formulated

not
by
jackson

but
by
danton

louis
blanc
tells
us


that
this
brutal
boanerges
of
the
jacobins
startled
even
his
allies
one


day

by
cynically
declaring
that

the
revolution
was
a
battle

and

like


all
battles

ought
to
end
by
the
division
of
the
spoils
among
the


victors







gabriel
charmes

a
republican
of
the
republicans

reviewing
the
conduct


of
the
governments
which
have
succeeded
each
other
in
france
with
such


kaleidoscope
rapidity
since
the
death
of
thiers

deliberately
declares


that

epuration
is
the
watchword

and
the
true
aim
of
republican


politics

in
france

and

epuration

is
the
euphemism
invented
to


describe
the
simple
process
of
kicking
out
the
office
holder
who
is
in



to
make
room
for
the
office
seeker
who
is
out

gambetta
began
this


process
in
december


when
he
wrote
to
the
government
at
paris




authorise
me
and
all
my
colleagues
to

purify

the

personnel

of
the


public
administration

and
it
shall
be
done
in
very
short
order


within


a
month

the
minister
of
the
interior
telegraphed
to
the
prefects


you


are
authorised
to
make
all
the
changes
among
the
public
school
teachers



which

from
a
republican
and
political
point
of
view

you
may
think


desirable


m

cremieux

minister
of
justice

followed
the
work
up
so


energetically

that
by
the
end
of
the
year

he
declared
that
he
had



weeded
out
eighteen
hundred
justices
of
the
peace

and
two
hundred
and


eighty
nine
magistrates
of
the
courts
and
tribunals


when
the


republicans
of
the
different
radical
shades
got
into
power
in


the


newly
elected
deputies

according
to
m

floquet

held
a
meeting

and


insisted
upon
a
further

epuration


they
were
of
the
mind
of
the


sub
prefect
of
roanne

who
telegraphed
to
his
superior


if
republicans


alone
are
not
put
into
office

the
republicans
will
rise
and
we
shall


have
civil
war


in
january


m

de
freycinet

then

as
now

a


minister

loudly
called
for
a

reform
of
the

personnel

of
the


administration

and
m

gabriel
charmes

speaking
of
the
then


situation
in
france

tells
us
that
only
one
prefect
of
the
previous


republican
administration
had
escaped

purification


and
not
one


procureur
general


has
a
single
justice
of
the
peace


he
added


or
a


single
public
school
teacher
in
the
slightest
degree
open
to
suspicion



escaped
the
avenging
hands
of
mm

le
royes
and
jules
ferry

certainly


not







this
was
nine
years
ago

so
thorough
was
the
weeding

m

charmes
tells


us

that


even
the
rural
constables
had
not
escaped

and
the
epuration


policy
had
carried
terror
and
anarchy
into
all
branches
of
the
public


service







in

more
than
three
millions
of
voters
recorded
their
protest


against
these
methods
of
government

and
against
the
deputies
who
had


identified
these
methods
with
the
republican
form
of
government

this


protest
was
met
by
m

de
freycinet

on
january




with
a
speech



in
the
course
of
which
he
calmly
said


let
no
one
henceforth
forget


that
liberty
to
oppose
the
government
does
not
exist
for
the
servants
of


the
state







that
is
to
say

the
republican
government

which
is
itself
the
servant



and
the
paid
servant

of
the
state

will
not
permit
any
of
its


fellow
servants
and
subordinates

who
are
also
presumably
french


citizens
and
taxpayers

to
form
and
express
at
the
polls
any
opinion
on


public
affairs
differing
from
the
opinions
held
by
the
ministers
who


make
up
the
government






it
was
upon
this
simple
and
beautiful
principle
that
mr

tweed
and
his


colleagues
consolidated
the
local
administration
of
affairs
of
the
city


of
new
york

applied
to
the
administration
of
the
affairs
of
thirty
six


millions
of
people
in
france

it
ought
certainly
to
produce
results
far


transcending
in
splendour
any
achieved
by
the
tammany
ring

for
m



gabriel
charmes
is
quite
in
the
right
when
he
says
that

under
this
word


of

epuration

lie
concealed
the
most
deplorable
forms
of
personal


greed

and
the
least
avowable
personal
spites
and
rancours


like
other


clever
devices

however


epuration

may
possibly
be
carried
too
far

if


it
comes
to
pass
that
no
actual
functionary
thinks
his
head
safe

while



at
the
same
time

every
office
the
government
has
to
give
represents
a


dozen
or
twenty

expurgated


and
therefore
exasperated
and
disaffected



previous
holders
of
that
office

the
confidence
of
the
garrison
may
be


shaken
while
the
animosity
of
the
assailants
is
intensified

this
point


may
possibly
have
been
reached
in
france

if
it
has
not
been
reached



the
influence
of
the
government
upon
the
voters
must
be
very
formidable



for
the
average
french
voter
is
hemmed
in
and
hedged
about
by


innumerable
small
functionaries
who
have
it
in
their
power
to
oblige
or


to
disoblige
him

to
gratify
or
to
vex
him
in
all
sorts
of
ways

and


though
the
ballot
is
supposed
to
be
sacred
and
secret
in
france

it
can


hardly
be
more
sacred
or
more
secret
there
than
in
other
countries

and


whatever
protection
against
annoyance
the
ballot
may
give
to
the
voter



nothing
can
protect
the
candidate






what
i
have
heard
in
other
regions
i
hear
in
artois

that
nothing
is
so


difficult
as
to
persuade
men
of
position
and
character
to
take
upon


themselves
the
troubles

and
expose
themselves
to
the
inconveniences

of


an
important
political
candidacy

there
are
a
hundred
ways
in
which
a


triumphant
administration
conducted
on
the
principles
of
the

epuration



policy
may
harass
and
annoy
an
unsuccessful
banner
bearer
of
the


opposition

the
question
of
expense
is
another
obstacle
in
the
way
of
a


thorough
organisation
of
public
opinion
against
such
a
government






an
average
outlay
of


francs
per
department
would
be
required

i


was
told
by
an
experienced
friend
in
paris

adequately
to
put
into
the


line
of
political
battle
all
the
departments
of
france

large
and
small


together

as
there
are
eighty
three
departments
in
france

this
gives
us


a
total
of



francs

or
some



l


sterling

as
the


cost
of
a
thorough
political
campaign
against
an
established
french


government

if
we
suppose
each
deputy
to
make
a
personal
contribution
of




francs
to
this
war
chest

that
will
give
us
only
about
one
third


of
the
necessary
amount

the
rest
must
be
made
up
by
the
personal


contributions
of
public
spirited
citizens

and
my
own
observation
of


public
affairs

going
back

now

over
a
good
many
lively
and
interesting


political
conflicts
in
the
united
states

leads
me
to
believe
that


liberal
contributions
of
this
sort
are

as
a
rule

more
easily
collected


by
the
beneficiaries
of
a
more
or
less
unscrupulous
government
actually


in
power

than
by
the
disinterested
advocates
of
a
real
political


reformation






we
wound
up
the
day
of
the
conference
with
a
delightful
little
dinner
at


st

quentin

the
traditions
of
the
old
french

cuisine

are
not
yet


extinct
in
the
provinces

nor

for
that
matter

in
the
private
life
of


the
true
parisians
of
paris

they
all
centre
in
the
famous
saying
of


brillat
savarin

that
a
man
may
learn
how
to
cook

but
must
be
born
to


roast

a
saying
worthy
of
the
philosophic
magistrate
who

coming
to


america

under
the
impression
that
he
was
to
be
fed
upon
roots
and
raw


meat

went
back
to
france
convinced
that
a
new
england
roast
turkey
and


an
indian
pudding
were
not
to
be
matched
in
the
old
world

it
is
one
of


the
many
curious
things
of
this
curious
world
of
the
nineteenth
century



that
a

cuisine

of
made
dishes
of
which
grimod
de
la
reyniere
long
ago


gave
us
the
origin

in
the
downfall
of
the
kitchens
of
the


prince
bishops
along
the
rhine

should
be
gravely
and
generally
accepted


by
frenchmen
themselves

or
at
least
by
the
parisians
of
literature
and


the
boulevards

as
the
national

cuisine

of
france

the
charming


daughter
of
my
host
at
st

quentin
knew
better

and
she
received
with
a


graceful

housewifely
satisfaction
the
neatly
turned
compliments
which


one
of
the
guests
was
old
fashioned
and
sensible
enough
to
pay
her
upon


the
skill
of
her
cook






the
city
of
aire
sur
la
lys
itself

like
st

omer

shows
traces
still
of


its
connection
with
flanders
and
with
spain

i
do
not
know
if
it
is
true


of
aire
as
m

lauwereyns
de
roosendaele

writing
about
jacqueline


robins

declares
it
to
be
of
st

omer

that
there
are
people
there

even


now

who
think
of
the
days
of
the
spanish
rule
as
the

good
old
times




but
there
is
a
certain
castilian
stateliness
about
the
older
buildings


of
aire

and
the
portals
of
the
larger
residences

leading
from
the


street
into
charming
secluded
courts

gay
with
trees
and
flowers

remind


one
of
the
zaguans
of
the
andalusian
houses

very
spanish

too

is
the


jesuit
church

despite
some
extraordinary
decorations
due
to
the
zeal
of


its
more
recent
possessors






the
flemish
past
of
the
city
is
commemorated
especially
by
a
very


remarkable
little
building
known
as
the
corps
de
garde

and
by
certain


portions
of
the
church
of
st

pierre






aire
formerly
had
a
cathedral

but
during
the
worst
period
of
the
terror


that
exemplary
ruffian

joseph
lebon
of
arras

the
unfrocked
priest

who


organised
pillage
and
massacre
throughout
the
pas
de
calais

frightened


the
good
people
of
aire
into
a
frenzy
of
destruction
and
devilry

the


church
of
st

pierre
was
then
a
collegiate
church

but
it
was
turned


over
to
the
worship
of
the
supreme
being
invented
by
robespierre



desecrated
and
defaced
and
left
in
a
deplorable
state

it
had
already


suffered

like
so
many
other
churches
all
over
france
and
england

from


the
ingenious

restorers

of
the
eighteenth
century

who
have
left
their


sign
manual
on
the
upper
part
of
the
edifice
and
on
the
mass
of
a
huge


organ
loft
which
crushes
and
disfigures
the
main
entrance

the
greater


part
of
the
building
is
of
the
fifteenth
century

and
it
has
been


restored
within
our
own
times
as
tastefully
and
effectively
as
in
the


circumstances
was
possible

under
the
supervision
and
in
part

i


believe

at
the
cost
of
a
devoted
and
conscientious
curate

a
member
of


a
scotch
family
long
fixed
in
artois

the
abbe
scott

who
took
charge
of


the
church
at
the
end
of
the
reign
of
charles
x

and
who
now
lies
buried


in
the
building
he
did
so
much
to
preserve

it
is
a
very
considerable


church

measuring
three
hundred
feet
in
length
and
a
hundred
and
twenty


in
width

with
a
height
of
seventy
feet
in
the
main
nave

the
ogival


windows
are
filled
with
rich

stained
glass

all
the
ancient
monuments


which
escaped
the
fury
of

have
been
excellently
restored

and
the


church
bears
witness
in
its
condition
to
the
active
piety
of
the


faithful
of
aire






the

corps
de
garde

is
a
quadrilateral
jewel
of
flemish
architecture
of


the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century

it
was
of
old
the
central
point
of
the


city

where
the
armed
citizens
met
who
patrolled
the
streets
like
the


burghers
of
rembrandt
s
magnificent

ronde
de
nuit


a
gallery
runs


round
it
of
arcades

and
brickwork
supported
by
monolithic
columns



above
these
arcades
runs
a
frieze
of
trophies
of
arms
with
the


attributes
of
st

james

the
mayor
of
the
city
in
whose
time
it
was


built
bore
the
name
of
this
apostle

and
the
cross
of
burgundy






the
principal
facade
fronts
the

grande
place


and
is
surmounted
by
a


picturesque
pointed
roof

an
attic
storey

running
all
around
the


building

is
richly
decorated
with
sculptures
of
the
theological
and


cardinal
virtues

the
four
elements

and
the
patron
saints
of
aire

st



nicholas
and
st

anthony

on
another
facade
is
the
sculptured
niche

now


vacant

wherein
stood
a
statue
of
the
virgin

before
which
all
the


great
processions

civic
and
military

were
used
to
halt
and
do


obeisance






in


after
the
death
of
charles
the
bold

louis
xi

of
france


succeeded


by
treachery
and
corruptions


in
annexing
aire
for
a
time


to
the
french
crown

and
the
local
records
give
a
picturesque
account
of


a
french
tournament
held
here
in


the
year
of
the
discovery
of


america

under
the
auspices
of
no
less
a
person
than
the
chevalier

sans


peur
et
sans
reproche


pierre
du
terrail

dit
le
bayard

came
to
aire


on
july

in
that
year

and
at
once
sent
a
trumpeter
to
proclaim


through
all
the
streets
and
squares
that
on
the
morrow

being
july




he
would
hold
a
tournay
under
the
walls
of
aire

for
all
comers


of


three
charges
with
the
lance

the
steel
points
dulled

and
twelve
sword


strokes
to
be
exchanged

with
no
lists
drawn

and
on
horseback
in


harness
of
battle


the
next
day
the
combat
to
be
renewed

afoot
with


the
lance
until
the
breaking
of
the
lance

and
after
that
with
the


battle
axe
so
long
as
the
judges
might
think
fit


the
chroniclers


celebrate
in
superlatives
the
valour
and
skill
shown
by
the
hero
in


these
gentle
and
joyous
assaults
of
arms

and
the
beauty
of
the
artesian


dames
and
damsels
who
thronged
from
all
the
country
round
into
aire
to


witness
the
tournay

and
take
part
in
the
dances
and
banquets
which


followed
it

but
the
hearts
of
the
people
were
evidently
flemish
and


spanish

not
french

for
they
hailed
the
restoration
of
the
austrian


authority
by
charles
the
fifth
with
all
manner
of
rejoicings

charles



with
his
usual
sagacity

confirmed
all
the
ancient
rights
and
privileges


of
the
city
and
its
corporations

which
had
been
a
good
deal
disturbed


under
the
centralising
rule
of
the
french
sovereigns

and
a
record
of


the
year

tells
us
that
on
the
proclamation
in
that
year
of
the


truce
of
borny

the
austrian
authorities
paid
the
treasurer
of
the
city



lxxviii

sols

for
silver
money

thrown
in
joy
to
the
people


the


treasurer
himself
seems
to
have
been
so
enthusiastic
on
this
occasion


that
he
threw
his
own
cap
after
the
silver
money

for
the
record
adds
a


further
payment
to
him

for
a
certain
cap
belonging
to
him

which
was


likewise
thrown
to
the
people


all
the
records
of
this
age
at
aire
are


picturesque
with
lively
accounts
of
all
manner
of
junketings

carousals



and
festivities

and
the
good
people
seem
to
have
passed
no
small
part


of
their
lives
in
merry
making

there
is
a
curious
entry
on
the
occasion


of
the
marriage
of
the
archduke
philip
to
mary
of
england

this


auspicious
event
was
celebrated
at
aire
by
a
grand
procession

followed


by

songs
and
ballads
in
honour
of
the
married
pair


and
the
treasurer


paid
to

johan
gallant

goldsmith

iiii

livres
iiii

sols
for
the


silver
presents

to
wit

an
eagle

a
leopard

a
lion

and
a
fool

all
in


silver

which
were
given
to
those
who
made
the
songs

ballads

and
games


in
honour
of
the
said
good
news







like
calais

st

omer

and
other
cities
of
this
region

aire
offered
a


refuge
in

to
the
unfortunate
inhabitants
of
the
ancient
historic


city
of
therouanne

which

after
a
heroic
defence
by
d
esse
de


montmorency

was
taken
in
that
year

five
days
after
the
death
on
the


ramparts
of
the
gallant
commander

by
the
troops
of
charles
the
fifth



and
by
his
orders
razed
to
the
ground

the
details
of
this
merciless


destruction
recall
the
sack
of
rome
by
the
imperialists

and
it
is
the


blackest
feature
in
the
black
record
of
the
first
french
revolution
that


the
men
who
then
got
control
for
a
time
of
the
government
of
france

in


the
names
of
liberty
and
progress

deliberately
and
wantonly
rivalled


the
most
unscrupulous
of
the
kings
and
emperors
whom
they
were


constantly
denouncing

in
their
treatment

not
of
foreign
fortresses


conquered
in
war

but
of
french
cities

of
the
lives
and
the
property
of


french
citizens

and
of
the
most
precious
monuments
of
french
history



charles
the
bold
at
dinant
and
charles
the
fifth
at
therouanne
were


outdone

in
the
prostituted
name
of
the
french
people

by
the
younger


robespierre
at
toulon
and
by
the
paralytic
couthon
at
lyons






the
annals
of
these
north
eastern
cities
of
modern
france
are
full
of


most
curious
and
valuable
materials
for
a
really
instructive
history
of


the
french
people

the
most
cursory
acquaintance
with
them
suffices
to


show
how
much
worse
than
worthless
are
the
huge
political
pamphlets


which
during
the
last
hundred
years
have
passed
current
with
the
world


as
histories
of
the
french
revolution

and
how
important
to
the
future



not
of
france
alone
but
of
civilisation

is
the
work
begun
in
our
own


times
by
writers
like
mortimer
ternaux

granier
de
cassagnac



baudrillart

bire

and
henri
taine

here
in
artois

under
the


conflicting
influences
of
flemish

spanish

and
french
laws
and
customs



a
genuine
development
of
social
and
political
life
may
be
traced
as


clearly
as
in
scotland
or
in
england

down
to
the
sudden
and
violent


strangulation
of
french
progress
by
the
incompetent
states
general
and


the
not
less
incompetent
king
in







the
archives
of
aire
show
that
the
question
of
public
education
was
a


practical
question
there

at
least
as
far
back
as
at
the
beginning
of


the
seventeenth
century

in


the
magistrates
asked
and
obtained
the


permission
of
the
archduke
albert
and
the
archduchess
isabella
to
lay
a


special
tax
on
the
city
of
aire
and
two
adjoining
villages

for
the


purpose
of
founding
a
college

private
citizens
having
already
given
an


endowment
of

florins
a
year
for
this
object

the
importance
of
this


contribution
may
be
estimated
from
the
fact
that
after
the
siege
of
aire


by
the
french
in


a
sum
of
i

florins
left
to
the
collegiate


church
of
aire
by
a
canon
of
tournay
was
found
sufficient
to
restore
the


chapel
of
our
lady

the
whole
right
wing
of
the
church

and
many
houses


belonging
to
the
canons

which
had
all
been
destroyed
by
the
french


artillery

no
time
was
lost
in
opening
the
college
to
the
youth
of
the


city
and
the
suburbs

and
only
a
few
years
afterwards
the
priests
in


charge
of
it
wrote
to
the
seigneur
de
thiennes

asking
for
further


endowments
in
order
to
increase
the
number
of
the
teachers
to
twenty

so


great
was
the
affluence
of
scholars
from
all
the
country
around


to
the


number
at
that
time
of
more
than
three
hundred


the
collegiate
chapter


of
aire
appointed
one
of
its
canons
superintendent
of
the
school

under


the
title
of
the

ecolatre


there
really
seems
to
be
as
little


foundation
in
fact
for
the
common
notion
that
there
was
no
provision


made
for
the
education
of
the
people
in
france
before


as
for
the


notion

not
less
common

that
there
were
no
peasant
proprietors
in


france
before


it
is
hardly
excusable
even
that
mr

carlyle



rhapsodising
more
than
fifty
years
ago
about
the

dumb
despairing


millions


should
have
fallen
into
this
error

for
though
de
tocqueville


and
taine
had
not
then
exploded
it
in
detail

necker

in
whose
career


carlyle
took
so
much
interest

not
only
declared
officially
that
there


was

an
immense
number

of
such
proprietors
in
france

but
took
the


trouble
to
explain
how
it
had
come
about

the
law
of

establishing


the
land
tax
required
every
parish
to
furnish
a
detailed
account
of
the


then
existing
properties
in
land

and
it
is
shown
by
these
that
there


then
existed
in
france
nearly
two
thirds
as
many
landholders
as
now


exist

although
the
population
of
the
country
is
now
about
twenty
five


per
cent

greater
than
it
then
was

with

entitles

really
one
of
the
most
interesting
of


french
cities

no

need
to
be
told
that
its


glorious
cathedral
makes
it
one
of
the
most
interesting

not
of
french

but
of
european
cities

two

excellent
small
hotels

it
a
most
comfortable

if
also
as


undefinable

as
hazlitt
found
the

look
of
a
gentleman

to
be

york
and


exeter

for
example

in
england

have
this
look

while
liverpool
and


hull
have
it
not

there
are
traces
of
the
spaniards
in
amiens

as
there


are
wherever
that
most
roman
of
all
the
latin
peoples
has
ever
passed



and
the
curious

hortillonages

of
amiens

which
may
be
roughly


described
as
a
kind
of
floating
kitchen
gardens

remind
one
so
strongly


of
the
much
more
picturesque
chinampas
of
mexico
as
to
suggest
the


impression
that
the
idea
of
establishing
them
may
have
come
hither
by


way
of
spain






at
the
present
time

amiens
is
a
point
of
no
small
political
interest



it
is
the
bailiwick
of
one
of
the
few
really
notable
men
of
the
actual


republican
party
in
france



m

goblet

and
yet
it
is
one
of
the


strongholds
of
boulangism

there
is
an
old
song

the
refrain
of
which



as
i
heard
it
sung

more
years
ago
than
i
care
to
recall

always
haunts


me
when
i
visit
this
ancient
city










vive
un
picard

vive
un
picard





quand
il
s
agit
de
tete






the
picards
have
always
shown

not
only
sense

but
a
kind
of
stubborn


independence
of
character

in
the
days
of
anarchy
which
came
upon
france


with
the
brief
but
ill
omened
triumph
of
the
girondins

amiens
was
the


first
of
the
french
provincial
cities
to
resist
and
denounce
the
too


successful
attempt
of
danton
and
the
commune
of
paris
to
terrorise


france
by
a
skilful
abuse
of
the
imbecility
of
roland

the
authorities


of
amiens
were
the
first
to
protest
against
the
outrageous
pretensions


of
the

commissioners


who
came
there
with
roland
s
commissions
in
one


hand

and
the
secret
instructions
of
roland
s
colleague
and
master



danton

in
the
other

to
pillage
the
property
of
the
inhabitants
under


the
pretence
of
gathering
supplies
for
the
national
defence

and
to


establish
an
irresponsible
local
despotism
under
the
pretence
of


suppressing

treason


to
them

in
the
first
instance

belongs
the


credit
of
compelling
roland
to
get
up
before
the
assembly
on
september






and
confess
that
he
had

signed
in
the
council
commissions


without
knowing
anything
about
the
commissioners
who
were
to
use
them




and
to
them

therefore

in
the
first
instance

history
is
indebted
for


the
formal
record
which
shows
that
the
actual
fall
of
the
french


monarchy
was
followed

and
its
formal
abolition
preceded

by
the
letting


loose
upon
france
of
a
swarm
of
scoundrels

who
filled

the
prisons
with


prisoners
as
to
whom
no
one
knew
by
whom
they
were
arrested

who
gave


over
to
pillage
the
treasures
accumulated
in
the
tuileries

and
in
the


houses
of
the
emigrant
aristocracy

who
conveyed
away
everything
which


could
tempt
the
cupidity
of
a
subaltern

without
any
record
whatever



and
who
were
delivering
over
paris
and
france
to
the
most
absurd
folly


and
the
most
insatiable
greed


it
was
not
the
fault
of
amiens
if
the


efforts
of
mazuyer
and
kersaint
demanding
a
law
to
show

whether
the


french
nation
was
sovereign

or
the
commune
of
paris


and
the
sonorous


eloquence
of
vergniaud
denouncing
the

citizens
of
paris

as
the

slaves


of
the
vilest
scoundrels
alive


only
led
in
the
end
to
making
france


herself
for
a
time
the
slave
of
these
same

vilest
scoundrels
alive







in
more
recent
times

amiens
received
and
entertained
gambetta
on
his


way
by
balloon
from
paris
to
tours

i
asked
the
veteran
count
leon
de


chassepot

who
for
years
was
regularly
returned
at
every
election
at
the


head
of
the
municipal
councillors
of
amiens

how
the
people
received


gambetta
on
that
memorable
occasion

his
answer
was
that
there
really


was
no

reception


gambetta
came
down
in
his
balloon
at
a
little
place


some
way
off

between
amiens
and
montdidier

and
when
he
reached
amiens


he
was
too
tired
and
hungry
to
think
of

receiving

people
or
making


speeches

count
leon
de
chassepot
had
nothing

i
believe

to
do
with
the


invention
of
the
guns
which
bear
his
name

but
he
has
a
glance
like
a


rifle
shot

and
at
fourscore
years

spring
still
makes
spring
in
the


mind

of
this
vivacious
veteran

i
asked
him
how
amiens
behaved
when
the


news
came
there
of
the
capture
of
paris
by
the
revolutionists
of


september




was
the
new
republic
hailed
with
enthusiasm




enthusiasm


he
said
scornfully


why
should
it
be

the
people
of


amiens
were
thinking
of
fighting
the
prussians

not
of
upsetting
the


government

they
received
the
news
with
stupefaction

as
a
matter
of


little
consequence
in
comparison
with
the
invasion

the
disaster
of


sedan
had
afflicted
them
profoundly

the
empire
was
popular
in
picardy



at
the
municipal
elections
which
took
place
in
amiens
just
after
the


declaration
of
war

early
in
august


that
is

the
imperialist


candidates
had
all
been
elected
by
overwhelming
majorities

m

goblet



now
so
prominent
in
the
republican
counsels

made
his
appearance
then
as


an
anti
governmental
candidate

together
with
m

petit

the
present


radical
mayor
of
amiens

m

goblet
got

votes

and
m

petit


they


were
the
leading
persons
on
that
side

and
the
leading
persons
on
the


side
of
the
government
received

respectively



and


votes



this
being
the
temper
of
the
good
people
of
amiens
at
that
time

you


will
understand
that
they
were
more
astounded
than
pleased
by
the


so
called
revolution
of
september
in
paris

but
they
were
more
patriotic


than
the
people
of
paris

and
they
acquiesced
in
the
overthrow
of
the


government
to
show
a
united
front
to
the
enemy

he
was
within
striking


distance
of
amiens

by
the
way

and
the
boulevardiers
unfortunately


thought
that
paris
was
out
of
his
reach







the
first
act
of
the
revolutionists
of
september

it
appears

was
to


disorganise
as
far
as
they
could
the
public
service
by
removing
the


prefects

and
putting
their
own
people
into
place
and
power

they
sent
a


certain
m

lardiere
down
post
haste
to
amiens
to
take
the
place
of
the


then
prefect
of
the
somme

m

de
guigne

and
that
was
all
they
did
to


defend
amiens






in
the
course
of
a
pleasant
morning
spent
with
m

ansart

a
gentleman
of


high
character
and
position
in
amiens

and
with
several
of
his
friends



i
heard
much
that
was
interesting
as
to
this
critical
period

the


attitude
of
the
leading
men
throughout
picardy
seems
to
have
been
in


complete
conformity
with
m

de
chassepot
s
account
of
the
bearing
of
the


city
of
amiens

the
mayor
of
a
commune
not
far
from
amiens

a
marquis


and
a
leading
imperialist

on
getting
the
news
of
the
political


somersault
executed
at
paris

read
out
the
bulletin
to
the
people
from


the
mairie

reminded
them
that
the
enemy
were
sure
to
come
into
picardy



and
then
exclaimed


well

my
friends

since
it
seems
we
are
in
a


republic

long
live
the
republic







this
was
the
general
feeling
of
good
men
everywhere
at
that
time
in


france

said
one
gentleman

a
landed
proprietor
from
brittany


nobody


out
of
paris
who
had
a
head
on
his
shoulders
approved
what
had
been


done
in
paris

but
by
common
consent
a
great
blank
credit
was
opened
for


the
republic
all
over
france

if
the
republicans
would
do
their
duty
to


france

not
as
party
men
but
as
patriots

france
was
ready
to
accept


them

it
is
their
own
fault

and
their
fault
alone

that
the
men
who


made
this
change
at
paris
went
to
pieces
so
fast
in
the
public


estimation

it
is
the
fault
of
the
republicans

and
their
fault
alone



that
now

after
nearly
eighteen
years

they
are
an
offence
to
sensible


and
liberal
men
from
one
end
of
france
to
the
other







the
new
prefect
sent
down
from
paris
turned
out
to
be
a
wind
bag

by
the


middle
of
november
it
became
clear
that
amiens
must
fall
into
the
power


of
the
enemy

the
new
prefect
launched
a
ridiculous
proclamation



blazing
with
adjectives

at
the
advancing
teutons

and
then
one
fine


night
got
out
of
the
way
as
fast
as
possible

leaving
the
city
and
the


department
of
the
somme
to
face
the
wrath
of
the
not
very
placable


conquerors






on
november


the
prussians
occupied
the
city

one
french
officer



commandant
vogel

falling
at
his
post

which
he
refused
to
surrender



count
lehndorff

appointed
to
be
german
prefect
of
the
somme

came
down


upon
the
people
heavily
for
war
contributions

which
were
raised
under


the
management
of
m

dauphin

who
had
been
the
imperialist
mayor
of
the


city
ever
since


and
who
has
of
late
years
been
a
conspicuous


republican

as
peace
drew
near

amiens
had
to
borrow
five
millions
of


francs

for
which
m

dauphin
agreed
the
city
should
pay
m

oppenheim
of


brussels
a
commission
of

per
cent


and
issued
its
obligations
at





per
cent

for
fifty
years






naturally
the
germans
are
not
much
liked
at
amiens

count
de
chassepot


thinks
the
picards
in
general
really
want
war
with
germany

they
turned


out
very
generally
during
the
contest

he
commanded
a
battalion
of


national
guards
who
turned
out
in
full
force

not
a
man
missing

though


they
were
armed
with
wretched
old
muskets

and
perfectly
understood
what


that
must
lead
to
for
them

on
making
his
rounds
very
early
in
the


morning

he
found

in
an
advanced
post

at
a
point
of
great
danger

a


picket

a

sentinelle
perdue


who
proved
to
be
one
of
the
most


respectable
men
in
amiens

the
first
president
of
the
upper
court
of
the


city

nearly
sixty
years
of
age

doing
his
duty
as
a
private
soldier




in
a
hospital
here


said
m

de
chassepot


i
have
six
hundred


patients

every
man
of
them
is
eager
for
another
turn
with
the
germans







i
was
anxious
to
learn
when
and
how
it
was
that
m

goblet

just
now
the


leading
republican
personage
of
this
part
of
france

began
to
appear


conspicuously
on
the
horizon


not
till
gambetta
s
new
social
strata


began
to
appear


i
was
told

this
was
in


the
finances
of
the


city

left
in
a
sad
condition
by
the
war

had
been
put
into
order
by
the


municipal
council
which
was
elected
during
the
german
occupation
in




the
public
works
had
been
restored

fine
barracks
built

and
a


sufficient
number
of
school
houses

in
return
for
those
services
the


councillors
who
had
rendered
them
were
turned
out
in


m

dauphin


among
them

by
the
newly
organised

union
republicaine


this
put
m



goblet
at
last
into
the
council
with
his
ally

m

petit

the
latter


being
the
editor
of
a
radical
journal

the

progres
de
la
somme


which


the
military
governor
of
paris
had
ordered
to
be
suppressed
early
in




for
its
attacks
on
the
then
president

marshal
macmahon

in



m

goblet
became
mayor
of
amiens







the
very
next
year

when
the
contest
began
between
gambetta
as
head
of


the
union
of
the
left
and
the
president
of
the
republic

m

goblet
threw


himself
as
ex
mayor
of
amiens
openly
on
the
side
of
the
ex
dictator



and
made
such
speeches
that
he
was
dismissed
from
his
office
by
the


president
in
june









did
he
like
this








no

he
didn
t
like
it
at
all

as
minister
of
the
interior

in
more


recent
times

m

goblet
has
knocked
off
the
heads
of
a
great
number
of


mayors

but
when
his
own
head
was
knocked
off
in


he
loudly
and


scornfully
denounced
all
municipal
officers
who
would
stoop
to
accept


their
positions
from
the
national
government








in
that
you
have
the
whole
character
of
m

goblet


said
another


gentleman


i
have
known
him
from
childhood

he
is
not
a
bad
man

and



as
you
know

he
is
a
man
of
ability

one
of
the
very
few
able
men
to
be


found
acting
with
president
carnot

but
he
is
very
vain

very
ambitious



very
excitable

as
the
associate
of
petit

who
is
a
rampant
atheist

and


of
the
anti
clericals
generally

he
has
to
pose
as
an
unbeliever

but
he


is

in
fact

nothing
of
the
sort

his
wife
is
a
good
woman

and
he
goes


in
great
awe
of
her

which
i
think
to
his
credit

i
think
if
he
felt
his


health
suffering
he
would
go
to
confession
in
a
quiet
way
by
night

just


as
the
gambetta
prefect
ran
away
from
the
prussians
in


when
the


grand
funeral
of
admiral
courbet
took
place
at
abbeville

and
it
was


announced
that
monseigneur
freppel
would
come
and
deliver
the
funeral


service
over
that
noble
christian
sailor
and
patriot

the
victim
of


ferry

m

goblet
was
in
a
dreadful
state
of
mind

he
said
to
me


i


think
i
shall
not
attend
the
funeral



pray
why



well

i
wish
to


attend
it

but
i
am
sure
that
bishop
freppel
will
say
things
offensive


to
me



pray
accept
my
congratulations


i
replied


you
really
are
in


great
luck
that
the
first
orator
in
france
should
take
the
trouble
to


come
all
the
way
to
picardy
expressly
to
insult
you
on
such
an


occasion


so
he
thought
better
of
it
and
attended

and
his
sensible


wife
afterwards
thanked
me
for
preventing
her
husband
from
behaving
like


a
donkey








an
excellent
woman

madame
goblet








her
husband
owes
her
much

and
he
has
some
good
friends

comte
de


chassepot
prevented
him
from
playing
the
stupid
farce
of
a
roman
son
by


sacrificing
his
father
s
funeral
to
a
discussion
on
the
laicisation
of


the
schools

for

seeing
what
he
had
in
his
mind

comte
de
chassepot


simply
moved
an
adjournment
of
the
council

his
evil
genius
is
m

petit



now
a
senator

the
present
mayor
of
amiens

i
have
caught
m

goblet


offering
the
holy
water
with
his
hand
behind
my
back
to
his
wife

but
m



petit
is
an
outspoken
unbeliever

and
a
very
type
of
the
anti
christian


demagogue







upon
this
he
told
me
a
story
which

as
it
is
certainly
typical
of
the


proceedings
taken
against
religion
all
over
france
by
functionaries
of


m

petit
s
way
of
thinking

i
shall
set
down
here






in

all
the
crosses
and
stones
in
the
cemetery
of
the
madeleine
at


amiens
set
up
on
graves
held
by
temporary
concessions
had
to
be
removed


by
reason
of
the
lapse
of
these
concessions

the
then
mayor
and


municipal
council
had
them
sold

and
ordered
the
proceeds
to
be
spent
in


erecting
a
large
and
beautiful
cross
with
an
image
of
the
saviour

and


an
inscription
stating
that
this
crucifix
was
erected
in
memory
of
all


the
dead
buried
in
the
cemetery
whose
crosses
and
tombs
had
been


removed

this
crucifix

called
the

calvary
of
the
poor


was
thus
a


touching
monument
of
the
family
affection
of
the
poor
among
the
people


of
amiens

outraged
by
this
symbol

the
radical
mayor
of
amiens
caused


this
calvary
to
be
dismantled

in
the
night
of
november




and


the
crosses
to
be
sawn
in
pieces
and
thrown
away
beyond
the
limits
of


the
cemetery

surely
this
is
an
advance
beyond
robespierre

and
even


beyond
the
senseless
vandalism
which
solemnly
ordered
the
destruction
of


the
tombs
of
the
kings
and
heroes
of
france

even
robespierre

when


cambon
made
his
proposal
that
the
convention
should
violate
the
public


faith
pledged
by
the
constituent
assembly
to
the
support
of
the
french


clergy
by
the
state
in
exchange
for
the
seizure
by
the
state
of
the


property
of
the
church

had
sense
enough
to
say

in
a
letter
to
his


constituents
opposing
the
project

that

to
attack
religion
directly
was


to
strike
a
blow
at
the
morals
of
the
people


i
am
not
surprised
to
be


told
that

notwithstanding
the
support
given
him
by
the
central


government
of
the
republic
at
paris

this
worthy
mayor
has
speedily
lost


popularity
even
with
his
own
radical
party

and
that
in
the
most
recent


elections
he
barely
escaped
defeat


he
is
ensconced

though



comfortably
as
senator


said
my
shrewd
informant


and
i
dare
say
he


will
see
his
friend

m

goblet

turned
out
of
the
chamber

so

what
does


he
care

his
zeal
against
the
calvary
in
amiens
may
hurt
him
with
the


poor
people
upon
whose
faith
and
whose
affections
he
tramples

but

like


his
brutal
expulsion
of
the
sisters
from
their
schools
and
hospitals



and
his
truculence
towards
the
religious
processions
in
which
the


picards
delight

it
recommends
him
to
the
clique
who
have
got
our
poor


france
into
their
clutches
at
paris

and
who
pose
before
all
the
gaping


world
at
the
universal
exposition
as
friends
of
liberty
and
progress







the
laicisation
of
the
schools
has
been
pushed
forward
at
amiens

as


elsewhere

it
began
under
m

spuller

now
minister
of
foreign
affairs



who
was
made
prefect
of
the
somme
in


m

goblet

who
had
then
been


mayor
for
a
year

resigned

to
become
under
secretary
in
the
ministry
of


justice

and
the
prefect
put
m

delpech
in
his
place

everything

it


will
be
seen

was
moved
from
the
centre
at
paris







this
m

delpech
and
his
associates


said
one
of
my
informants


began


the
laicisation
of
the
boys

schools

they
were
men
who
would
not
think


of
picking
a
man
s
pocket

but
see
how
they
behaved
in
this
business







there
were
six
primary
schools
at
amiens
conducted
by
the
christian


brothers

five
of
these
had
always
been
so
conducted

and
the
sixth
for


twenty
years

the
christian
brothers
agreed
to
give
up
this
sixth


school

m

petit
promising
them
that

if
they
did
this

they
should
not


be
disturbed
in
the
others

very
soon
this
promise
was
broken

and
they


were
turned
out
of
the
school
of
notre
dame

then
a
charge
was
brought


against
one
of
the
brethren
of
the
school
of
st

leu

it
was
serious
and


went
before
the
assize
court

where
the
accused
was
promptly
acquitted



but
this
took
time

and
while
the
proceedings
were
pending

our


admirable
m

petit
sent
in
a
report
to
the
council
recommending
that
the


brethren
be
dismissed
from
their
four
remaining
schools

on
august






the
council
adopted
this
report

and
within
a
week
m

spuller

the


prefect

issued
an
order
of
expulsion


in
obedience


as
he
wrote


to


the
resolution
of
the
municipal
council
of
amiens

and
to
the
wishes
of


the
population








m

spuller
appears
to
be
a
true
disciple
of
robespierre

who

in
his


famous
socialistic
speech
before
the
convention

affirming
that
bread



meat

and
all
provisions
are
not
private

but
common

property

laid


down
the
maxim
that


even
if
the
measures
proposed
as
their
desire
by


the
people
are
not
necessary
in
the
eyes
of
law
makers

they
should
be


adopted



civium
ardor
prava
jubentium

is
a
moral
law
for
legislators


of
this
admirable
school






i
should
note
by
the
way
that
these
brethren

thus
expelled
summarily



were
refused
payment
of
their
already
fixed
salaries
for
the
month
of


september






a
debate
ensuing

the
question
was
finally
remitted
to
m

jules
ferry




grand
master
of
the
university
of
france


who
decided
that
the


salaries
were
indeed
due
and
the
property
of
the
brethren

but
that

as


the
work
could
not
be
done
by
reason
of
their
expulsion

the
salaries


need
not
be
paid






furthermore

the
municipality
appraised
the
school
furniture

which
had


been
bought
and
paid
for
by
the
brethren

and
having
ascertained
its


value

decided

that
it
belonged
to
the
municipality






will
my
readers
think
the
expression
of
m

fleury

an
accomplished


journalist
of
amiens

to
whom
i
am
indebted
for
these
details

at
all


too
vigorous

when
he
described
these
proceedings
as

exactly
defined
in


the
french
dictionary

and
in
the
th
article
of
the
penal
code

under


the
word

theft








in
august


on
the
refusal
of
the
sisters
in
charge
of
the
girls



school
to
take
their
pupils
to
an

obligatory
festival

during
the
time


fixed
on
sunday
for
divine
service

m

petit

the
municipal
emperor


julian
of
amiens

moved
for

the
immediate
laicisation
of
all
the
girls



schools
in
amiens


this
was
too
much
even
for
m

goblet

who

to
his


credit

not
only
protested
but
voted
against
the
proposition

it
was



however

carried

m

goblet
and
six
other
councillors
withdrew



including
the
mayor

m

delpech

and
m

petit
thus
became

by
seniority



mayor
of
amiens







when
this
happened


said
a
citizen
of
amiens
to
me


and
m

petit
was


thus
put
in
charge
of
the
rights
and
the
property
of
the
sisters

it
had


been
perfectly
well
known
for
ten
years
that

by
the
parliamentary


inquest
of

into
the
story
of
the
commune
of
paris

m

petit
had


been
proved
to
be
the
founder
at
amiens
of
the
secret
society
known
as


the

international


and
yet
he
was
never
prosecuted

and
he
is
now
a


senator
of
the
republic

how
do
you
expect
honest
people

who
respect


the
ordinary
laws
of
order
and
civilisation

to
support
a
republic
which


accepts
and
promotes
the
members
of
such
a
society







on
october




this
remarkable
mayor
went
in
person
with
a


locksmith
and
some
others
to
the
communal
girls

school
of
st

leu

then


managed
by
the
sisters

the
sisters
had
been
already
that
day
notified


to
leave
the
school
buildings

the
next
day


m

petit
ordered
them
to


go
out
immediately

they
showed
the
notification
and
declined
to
go
till


the
next
day

the
curate
of
st

leu

with
his
vicar
and
with
a
member
of


the
board
of
churchwardens

came
up
and
protested
against
this
invasion


of
the
school


show
me
the
documents
proving
this
house
to
be
the


property
of
the
municipality


said
the
curate

m

petit
showed
no


documents

but
demanded
the
keys

the
curate
refused
to
give
them
up

m



petit
ordered
his
locksmith
to
pick
the
locks

which
was
done

and
then


turning
to
the
curate
shouted
out


as
for
you

if
you
are
here
when
the


commissary
comes

i
will
have
you
turned
out
by
force


upon
this
the


curate

a
venerable
old
man

withdrew







from
the
school
of
st

leu
our
local
robespierrot
drove
to
the
girls



school
of
st

jacques

sprang
out
of
the
municipal
coach

paid
for
by


the
public
treasury


dashed
into
the
house

and
seated
himself
without


a
word







one
of
the
sisters
asked
him
civilly
what
he
wished


i
wish
you
to
get


out
of
this
house


he
replied


we
cannot
possibly
leave
in
this
way




answered
a
sister
who
has
for
years
devoted
herself
to
this
work


i


have
nothing
to
say
to
you


he
cried


i
want
the
superior


the


superior
quietly
came
and
informed
the
mayor
that
the
church
officers


had
told
her
not
to
leave

excepting
under
force


very
well

you
shall


have
force

if
you
are
not
all
out
of
here
by
tuesday

i
will
put
you


all
into
the
street








now
observe
the
consequences
to
the
taxpayer
of
amiens

the
church
of


st

leu

as
it
happens

owned
the
greater
part
of
the
school
buildings



the
church
began
proceedings
against
the
city

and
in
august


the


tribunal
ordered
the
city
to
give
up
the
buildings
seized
by
this


adventurous
mayor

and
to
withdraw
its
lay
teachers

the
upshot
was
that


the
performances
of
m

petit

in
one
way
or
another

although
m

goblet



then
in
the
ministry
at
paris

came
to
the
rescue
of
his
demagogic


ally

cost
the
taxpayers

in
round
numbers

some
fifty
thousand
francs



now
you
see
why
the
laicising
republicans
are
so
anxious
to
shake
the


whole
system
of
the
french
magistracy

there
may
be
judges
at
berlin

it


is
not
convenient
there
should
be
judges
in
republican
france







this
recalled
to
me
what
i
heard
the
other
day
at
calais
about
the


functionary
decorated
at
bapaume
by
president
carnot

because
the


tribunal
had
given
a
decision
against
him
in
a
case
raised
by
certain


christian
brothers
whom
he
had
unlawfully
put
out
of
property
which



under
the
law

belonged
to
them







you
think
that
a
remarkable
case


said
the
picard
friend
to
whom
i


mentioned
it


it
is
an
everyday
affair

wait
a
minute

let
me
show
you


the
documents
in
regard
to
a
performance
of
our
worthy
mayor
and


senator

which
throws
president
carnot
into
the
shade

they
are
as


amusing

too

as
they
are
instructive

and
i
will
give
you
copies
of


them
which
you
may
use
as
you
like

you
tell
me
people
in
england
and


america
have
no
idea
of
what
is
going
on
in
france

i
assure
you
that


people
in
france
who
know
what
is
going
on
around
them

have
no
idea
of


what
it
all
means

or
of
what
it
must
lead
to
in
the
end







sometimes
i
think
we
were
so
stunned
as
a
nation
by
the
invasion
and


the
commune
that
we
are
still
staggering
about
like
a
man
knocked
on
the


head
in
a
dark
road







but
let
me
tell
you
the
tale
of
m

petit
and
mademoiselle
colombel



mademoiselle
colombel
was
a
lay
teacher
at
the
head
of
one
of
our


schools

the
school
of
the
petit
st

jean

i
don
t
quite
see

by
the


way


he
observed


why
m

petit
and
his
squad
have
not
changed
the


names
of
these
schools

in
paris

you
know

they
had
the
courage
to


change
the
name
of
one
of
the
great
lyceums
into
the
lyceum
lakanal

to


be
sure
it
didn
t
stay
changed
very
long

for
even
paris

which
suffers


one
of
its
boulevards
to
commemorate
that
wretched
creature
victor


noir

wouldn
t
stand
lakanal

but
to
infect
the
minds
of
children
with


the
names
of
little
saints

surely
this
is
a
monstrous
thing

well



mademoiselle
colombel
lost
her
temper
one
day

and
tried
to
find
it


about
the
person
of
one
of
her
little
pupils

with
slaps

and
pinches



and
other
caresses
of
the
kind

she
was
brought
up
before
the
police
for


it

and
sentenced
to
pay
a
small
fine
with
costs

she
appealed

but
the


court
confirmed
the
sentence
of
the
police
magistrate

who
had
acted


strictly
within
the
law

what
followed

this
was
in
may


mdlle



colombel
declared
herself
to
be
a
persecuted
martyr
of

laicisation




and
in
that
capacity
called
upon
the
mayor

m

petit

for
aid
and


comfort

i
believe
they
were
old
allies
in
the
sacred
cause

be
this
as


it
may

the
mayor
made
himself
her
champion
against
the
magistrate

and


wrote
her

for
public
use

this
letter

pray
print
it

it
is
a
great


thing
for
amiens
to
possess
a
mayor

and
for
france
to
possess
a


senator

who
can
write
such
a
letter

it
ought
to
have
been
sent
to
the


exposition













amiens

may














madame


on
the
strength
of
calumnious
imputations
fomented
by
an







ulysses
who
could
not
console
himself
for
the
departure
of
calypso








and
complacently
listened
to

you
have
been
prosecuted
for
cruelty







to
your
pupils













after
an
inquiry
as
long
and
as
voluminous
as
if
the
matter
at







issue
had
been
a
case
for
the
assize
court

this
intrigue
came
to
a







miserable
end
before
a
simple
police
tribunal

from
the
moment








when

through
a
singular
sort
of
suspicion
about
your
natural







judges

you
were
removed
from
the
disciplinary
action
of
your







superiors

without
any
preliminary
inquiry
made
by
them

and








indeed

without
apprising
them
of
the
matter

you
should
have
been







taken
before
the
courts

nobody
seemed
to
understand
this

so
you







were
condemned
by
default
to
pay
a
fine

trifling
indeed

but
so







imposed
as
to
take
from
you
the
right
of
appeal

be
this
as
it
may








since
some
of
the
law
officers
of
the
republic
are
ready
to
revive







against
the
lay
instructors
of
our
schools

the
methods
of
the
law







officers
of
the
empire

it
is
well
your
colleagues
should
know







that

whilst
i
am
at
the
head
of
the
municipal
administration
of







amiens

they
shall
not
be
given
over
defenceless
to
the
rancour
of







the
clerical
world

its
dupes

or
its
accomplices

i
have
therefore







the
honour
to
inform
you
that
i
not
only
relieve
you
from
all
the







costs
of
your
case

but
that

in
order
to
soothe
the
trouble
it
may







have
caused
you

i
grant
you
an
indemnity
of
one
hundred
francs













against
the
sentence
which
condemned
you
put
this
proof
of
esteem







and
sympathy

honest
people
and
republicans
will
think
this







testimony
at
least
as
good
as
any
other

accept

madame

the







assurances
of
my
most
distinguished
consideration














the
mayor
of
amiens

















frederic
petit









ulysses
bewailing
the
departure
of
calypso
is
charming

is
it
not




said
my
friend


m

petit
is
a
cotton
velvet
manufacturer

and
his


classics
are
cotton
classics

but
what
do
you
say
to
the
applause
of



honest
people

acclaiming
a
mayor
who
puts
his
hand
into
the
public


treasury
and
makes
a
present
out
of
it
to
soothe
the
injured
feelings
of


a
schoolmistress
fined
by
a
public
tribunal
for
ill
treating
her
pupils



can
you
ask
for
a
more
flagrant
illustration
of
the
state
to
which
this


republic
is
bringing
our
public
services

and
the
mayor
who
wrote
this


letter

and
took
this
money
out
of
the
public
treasury

and
offered
this


open
insult
to
the
tribunals
of
the
city
of
amiens

has
since
then
been


made
a
senator
of
the
republic

with
the
help
and
concurrence
of
m



dauphin

then
first
president
of
our
courts

whose
plain
official
duty


it
was
to
revoke
his
commission
as
mayor
as
soon
as
this
letter
was


published

with
such
men
as
this
in
the
french
senate
do
you
wonder
the


country
laughs
at
senatorial
courts
of
justice

i
have
no
great
opinion


of
general
boulanger

though
i
have
as
good
an
opinion
of
him
as
of
m



clemenceau

who
invented
him

but
really
is
it
not
grotesque
to
see
such


cotton
velvet
senators
as
this
mayor
of
amiens
going
about
to
decide


questions
of
fidelity
to
public
duty

take
my
word
for
it

he
continued




it
is
the
direct
personal
knowledge
which
the
people
have
of
just
such


personages
as
the
mayor
of
amiens
all
over
france

which
makes


two
thirds
of
the
popular
strength
of
general
boulanger

if
the
senate


and
the
government
succeed
in
putting
about
the
impression
that
general


boulanger
is
no
better
than
they
are

they
will
no
doubt
weaken
him
with


the
people

but
they
will
not
strengthen
themselves

this
third
republic


is
dying

not
of
any
passion
for
the
monarchy

not
even
of
the


imperialist
legend

which
is
very
strong
in
the
country

more
because


france
was
so
prosperous
under
the
third
napoleon
than
because
france


dominated
europe
under
the
first
napoleon

it
is
dying
of
popular


contempt

it
is
dying
of
the
goblets

the
petits

the
dauphins

they
are


to
be
found
all
over
france

under
different
names

yes

but
always
the


same

shallow

vain

vulgar
sycophants
of
universal
suffrage
while
they


are
out
of
place

bullies
and
traders
when
they
are
in
power

and
then




he
exclaimed
after
a
pause


what
most
exasperates
me
is
that
they
are


such
a
pack
of
wordmongers

for
ever
ranting
about
things
which
may
have


intoxicated
our
grandfathers
in


they
don
t
seem
to
me
to
have


invented
gunpowder

our
grandfathers


but
which
simply
make
sensible


men
sick
to
day







wait
a
moment

let
me
complete
the
picture
of
our
model
picard


republican
senator
for
you

the
comte
de
chassepot
told
you
the
story



did
he
not

of
the
calvary
in
the
cemetery
of
the
madeleine

yes

but
he


did
not
show
you
the
correspondence
about
it
between
the
bishop
and
this


charlatan
of
twopenny
atheism

no

well
it
is
a
tit
bit

and
i
give
it


to
you

petit
sent
his
order
to
the
keeper
of
the
cemetery
of
the


madeleine
in
november


to
raze
the
cross

saw
off
the
arms

and


detach
from
it
the
image
of
christ

he
was
then

observe

not
really


mayor
of
amiens

but
only
mayor
by
reason
of
the
refusal
of
his
senior


to
serve
in
the
office







the
work
was
done
at
night

the
cross
was
destroyed

the
image
of
the


saviour
was
thrown
into
a
shed







two
days
afterwards

the
bishop

mr

prefect


a
most
deplorable
incident

indeed
a
grave







scandal

has
just
taken
place
at
the
cemetery
of
the
madeleine

and







is
exciting

with
too
much
reason

the
strongest
and
most
painful







feelings
among
the
people
of
amiens













the
figure
of
our
saviour
christ

set
up
there
in
very
special







circumstances

and
with
a
solemn
ceremony
in
which
more
than









spectators
took
part

was
clandestinely
thrown
down
and
taken
away







the
night
before
last

it
is
impossible
for
me
to
imagine
that
the







authorities
can
have
ordered
such
a
thing
to
be
done













i
must
request
you

mr

prefect

to
order
an
inquiry
to
be
made







into
this
inexplicable
affair

and
to
cause
the
authors
of
the
act







to
be
prosecuted
according
to
law

please
accept
the
assurance
of







my
respectful
regard

victor
francis

















bishop
of

to
this
letter

written
by
the
highest
ecclesiastical
authority
of
the


chief
city
of
his
prefecture

will
you
believe
it


m

spuller

who
is


after
all
not
a
perfectly
illiterate
person
like
petit

actually
made
no


reply







but
the
cotton
velvet
bagman
of
blasphemy
three
days
afterwards



reading
in
the
papers
the
letter
of
bishop
guilbert

burst
into
print


with
this
incredible
but
most
instructive
effusion

addressed
to
his


friend
the
prefect













amiens

nov

















mr

prefect


i
find
this
morning
in
the
journals
of
the







bishopric
the
text
of
a
letter
addressed
to
you
by
the
bishop
of







amiens
in
regard
to
the
suppression
of
the
catholic
emblem
placed







at
the
entrance
of
the
general
cemetery
of
the
madeleine













it
was
by
my
order

and
my
written
order

that
the
christ
of
the







madeleine
was
removed

the
only
failure
to
comply
with
my
orders







was
that
the
operation
was
performed
in
the
evening
after
the







cemetery
was
closed

instead
of
in
the
morning
as
i
had
directed








in
acting
thus

i
have
shown
great
tolerance

for

in
virtue
of







article

of
the
law
of
the
th
vendemiaire
of
the
year
iv









circumscribed
in
its
application

but
not
abrogated
by
the
law
of







the
th
germinal
year
x


as
is
shown
by
a
ministerial
decree
of







the
th
fructidor
following


no
sign
special
to
any
religion
can







be
raised

fixed

and
attached
in
any
place
whatever

so
as
to







strike
the
eyes
of
citizens

except
in
an
enclosure
intended
for







the
exercises
of
this
religion

or
in
the
interior
of
private







houses

in
the
studios
or
warehouses
of
artists
or
merchants

or
in







public
edifices
destined
to
contain
monuments
of
the
arts









then
followed
a
dozen
pages
of
similar
twaddle

meant
to
show
that
the


mayor
of
amiens
was
a
most
tolerant
prince

in
that
he
had
not
ordered


the
destruction
of
every
cross
set
up
on
a
private
grave







of
course
all
these
laws
of
the
first
republic
were
long
ago
shot
into


space
under
the
consulate
and
the
empire

and
of
course

even
if
they


had
not
been
shot
into
space

a
consecrated
cemetery
is
an

enclosure


intended
for
the
exercises
of
religion


but
what
did
that
signify
to
m



petit

who

in
a
public
speech
the
year
after

boasted
that
he

had
not


been
married
in
church

and
that
his
children
had
never
been
baptized








did
all
this
give
the
man
any
right
to
destroy
and
carry
away
a
costly


piece
of
artistic
work

the
property
of
the
city







obviously

it
is
as
absurd
to
expect
peace
and
order
in
france
under
a


republic
in
which
men
like
m

petit

and
m

spuller

and
m

dauphin

and


m

goblet
are
leading
friends
of
the
government

as
it
would
have
been


to
expect
peace
and
order
in
the
england
of
the
seventeenth
century



when
churchwardens

as
at
banbury

for
example

went
about
breaking
at


night
into
the
churches
confided
to
their
care

and
smashing
the
statues


of
the
saints
and
defacing
the
glorious
monuments
of
the
past






after
considering
all
these
humours
and
graces
of
the
most
recent
french


republic

as
set
forth
by
the
senatorial
mayor
of
amiens

for
the


edification
of
picardy
and
france

it
was
interesting
to
walk
with
mr



ruskin
from
the
place
de
perigord
up
the

street
of
the
three
pebbles




past
the
theatre
and
the
palais
de
justice

to
the
south
transept
of


that
glorious
cathedral
which
has
not
as
yet
been
taken
down
by
night



under
the
senatorial
mayor
or
his
friends
the
ministers

m

spuller
and


m

yves
guyot

why
should
this

parthenon
of
gothic
architecture


as
m



viollet
le
duc
calls
it

be
left
standing
when
the
calvary
of
the
poor


at
amiens
is
cast
down
and
sawn
in
pieces






for
surely
mr

ruskin

who
has
written
many
true
and
eloquent
things



has
written
nothing
truer
than
these
words
with
which
he
brings
to
a


close
his
remarkable
paper
called
the

bible
of
amiens















the
life
and
gospel
and
power
of
christianity
are
all
written
in







the
mighty
works
of
its
true
believers

in
normandy
and
sicily

on







river
islets
of
france
and
in
the
river
glens
of
england

on
the







rocks
of
orvieto
and
by
the
sands
of
arno

but
of
all

the







simplest

completest

and
most
authoritative
in
its
lessons
to
the







active
mind
of
northern
europe

is
this
on
the
foundation
stones
of







amiens

believe
it
or
not
as
you
will

only
understand
how







thoroughly
it
was
once
believed

and
that
all
beautiful
things
were







made
and
all
brave
deeds
done
in
the
strength
of
it

until
what
we







may
call

this
present
time


in
which
it
is
gravely
asked
whether







religion
has
any
effect
on
morals

by
persons

senatorial
and







other

who
have
essentially
no
idea
whatever
of
the
meaning
of







either
religion
or
morality
















chapter
vi






in
the
somme


continued











amiens





where
party
names
are
taken
from
persons

there
we
may
be
sure
that
the


people
are
either
losing

or
have
never
had

the
political
instincts


which
alone
can
make
popular
government
a
government
of
law
and
order



the
englishmen
who
are
readiest
to
proclaim
themselves

gladstonians




whatever
may
be
their
other
merits

are
hardly
perhaps
the
most
devoted


champions
either
of
the
british
constitution
as
it
is

or
of
strictly


constitutional
reform

in
france
to
day

the
republican
party
is
made
up


of
clans

each
taking
the
name
of
its
chief

there
are
ferryists
and


clementists

as
there
were
gambettists

and
the
government
of
the
day
is


putting
forth
all
its
strength
to
check
the
drift
over
of
what
i
suppose


i
may
without
impropriety
call
the
republican
residuum
into
boulangism



here
in
amiens
the
tide
seems
to
be
too
strong
for
the
authorities
at


paris

and
for
that
matter
throughout
the
department
of
the
somme

at


the
election
nearly
a
year
ago

on
august




of
a
deputy
to
fill


the
vacancy
caused
by
the
death
of
a
royalist
member

m

de
berly



general
boulanger
came
forward
as
a
candidate
and
was
elected
by
an


overwhelming
majority

there
are


electors
in
the
department

of


these



voted

general
boulanger
received


votes

and
his


republican
competitor

m

barnot

only



general
boulanger
having


been
elected
at
the
same
time
for
the
nord
and
the
charente
inferieure



general
boulanger
resigned
his
seat
and
his
republican
followers
cast


their
votes
for
a
royalist

general
de
montauban

who
was
elected

in


the
arrondissement
of
amiens

with


registered
voters

general


boulanger
had
a
majority

in


of


voters

the
whole
vote


thrown
there
being



yet

in


on
a
total
registration
of




voters

the
republican
candidates
for
amiens

m

goblet
and
m



dieu

were
elected
by
a
combined
majority
of


votes

if
the


boulangists
carry
amiens

therefore

at
the
legislative
election
this


year

it
may
be
taken
for
granted

i
think

that
m

goblet
and
his


friend
the
senatorial
mayor
have
not
educated
their
fellow
citizens
into


very
staunch
and
trustworthy
supporters
of
the
republic






m

fleury

the
editor
in
chief
of
the
conservative

echo
de
la
somme




who
made
a
pretty
thorough
canvass
of
the
department
before
the
election


of
august




gives
me
some
curious
details
as
to
that
election






the
monarchists

both
royalists
and
imperialists

gave
a
general
and


tacit

and
in
many
cases
an
overt
and
active

support
to
general


boulanger

their
object
being
the
same
as
his

to
bring
about
a
repeal


of
the
existing
law
of


which
was
passed
to
prevent
any
real


revision
of
the
constitution
in
a
sense
hostile
to
the
existing


republican
form
of
government

of
course
if
the
people
of
the
somme
had


really
cared
anything
about
the
republic
as
a
form
of
government

they


ought
to
have
defeated
general
boulanger

it
is
the
opinion
of
m

fleury


that
the
people
of
the
somme

and
indeed
of
picardy

not
only
care


little
or
nothing
about
the
republic
as
a
form
of
government

but


actually
and
by
a
considerable
majority
prefer
some
monarchical


form

probably

on
the
whole

the
empire






they
are
not
in
the
least
likely
to
express
this
preference
at
the


polls

because

in
common
with
the
vast
majority
of
the
electors


throughout
france

they
have
been
born
and
brought
up
to
take
their
form


of
government
from
paris

so
long
as
the
government
at
paris

be
it


royal

imperial

or
republican

controls
the
executive

the
people
of


the
provinces
are
extremely
unlikely
to
make
an
emphatic
effort
of
their


own
to
be
rid
of
that
government

if
louis
philippe

in


would
have


allowed
marshal
bugeaud
to
use
the
force
at
his
command
in
paris

the


republic
improvised
in
february
of
that
year
would
have
been
strangled


before
birth

to
the
extreme
satisfaction
of
an
enormous
majority
of
the


french
people

this
was
afterwards
overwhelmingly
shown
by
the
election


of
louis
napoleon

when
general
cavaignac

with
all
the
advantage
of
the


control
of
the
machinery
of
government
at
paris

could
secure
only
a


relatively
insignificant
popular
vote
at
the
polls
against
the


representative
of
the
imperial
monarchy

i
spent
the
winter
in
paris
two


years
afterwards
as
a
youth

during
my
first
tour
in
europe

and
i
there


heard
an
american
resident
of
paris

well
known
at
that
time
in
the


world
of
french
politics

mr

george
sumner

a
brother
of
the
senator


from
massachusetts

relate
in
the

salon

of
m

de
tocqueville
a
curious


story
of
the
days
of
february

which
strikingly
illustrates
the


disposition
of
the
french
provinces
at
that
time
to
take
whatever
paris


might
send
them
in
the
way
either
of
administration
or
of
revolution






the
king
refused
to
let
the
marechal
duc
d
isly
restore
order

as
there


is
no
doubt
he
could
easily
and
quickly
have
done


on
the
ground
that


he
had
received
the
crown
from
the
national
guard
in
paris

and
that
he


would
not
allow
it
to
be
defended
by
the
line
against
them

the
recently


published
letters
of
his
very
popular
son

the
duc
d
orleans

prove


that

had
that
prince
been
then
living

he
probably
would
never
have


allowed
this
scruple
to
stand
in
the
way
of
averting
a
social
and


political
catastrophe

but
the
duc
was
in
his
untimely
grave

and
the


control
of
events
fell
most
unexpectedly
into
the
hands
of
a
few
men
who


had
no
concerted
plan
of
action

and

indeed

hardly
knew
whether
they


were
awake
or
dreaming


they
proclaimed
a
republic


said
mr

sumner




because
they
did
not
know
what
else
to
do


but
they
were
in
a
state
of


utter
bewilderment
at
first

as
to
how
they
should
get
the
republic


accepted
by
the
provinces

a
happy
thought
struck
m

armand
marrast

in


those
days
the
french
railway
system
was
little
developed

most
of
the


mails
from
paris
were
carried
through
the
country
by
malles
postes
and


diligences

and
every
evening
an
immense
number
of
these
coaches
left


the
central
bureau
for
all
parts
of
france

m

marrast
sent
into
all
the


quarters
of
paris
and
impounded

in
one
way
or
another

the
services
and


the
paintpots
of
every
house
and
furniture
painter
upon
whom
his
people


could
lay
hands

these
were
all
set
to
work
upon
the
mail
coaches

the


royal
arms

with
the
charter
and
the
crown

were
painted
over

and
the


vehicles
which

from
paris

carried
to
all
parts
of
france
the
news
of


the
proclamation
of
the
republic
carried
everywhere
also
an
outward
and


visible
sign
of
the
establishment
of
the
new
government
in
the
words



republique
francaise

brightly
blazoned
upon
their
panels






i
recalled
this
story
to
mr

sumner
years
afterwards
in
new
york

and
he


assured
me
not
only
that
it
was
literally
correct

but
that
he
had
been


consulted
himself
about
it
by
m

marrast
at
the
time

this
particular


device
could
not
now
be
used
as
effectively

but

with
the
telegraph


wires
and
the
telephones
in
its
control

any
government
which
may
get


itself
installed
to
morrow
in
paris
would
certainly
have
tremendous
odds


in
its
favour

from
one
end
of
france
to
the
other

the
immense
increase


of
the
french
public
debt
under
the
republican
administration
since



has
correspondingly
increased

all
over
france

the
number
of
people


known
as

petits
rentiers


who

having
invested
their
savings

in
part


or
wholly

in
the
public
securities

will
be
as
quick
to
acquiesce
in


any
revolution
which
they
believe
to
have
been
successful
at
paris

as


they
are
slow
to
promote
any
revolution

no
matter
how
desirable


otherwise
a
change
in
the
government
may
seem
to
them
to
be

so
long
as


it
is
not
shaken
out
of
the
public
offices
at
paris

the
government
of


the
republic
may
probably
count
upon
this
vast
body
of
quiet
people

as


confidently
as
the
empire
counted
upon
it
twenty
years
ago

or
as
the


monarchy
or
the
dictatorship
might
count
upon
it
to
morrow

were
the


king
or
the
dictator
acclaimed
in
the
capital






m

fleury
cites
one
of
general
boulanger
s
most
active
supporters

m



mermieix

as
saying
to
him
during
the
election
in



with
a
few


millions
of
francs

the
liberty
of
the
press
and
of
public
billsticking



and
three
thousand
rowdies

i
can
change
the
government
of
this
country


in
less
than
a
year







the
remark
is
slightly
cynical

but
the
extreme
anxiety
of
the


government
of
the
republic
to
get
general
boulanger
either
into
a
prison


or
out
of
paris
certainly
goes
far
to
justify
the
boast
of
m

mermeix







i
told
general
boulanger
at
doullens


said
m

fleury

after
going


thither
in
company
with
him
from
amiens


that
he
was
sure
of
his


election

my
reason
was
that
while
i
saw
little
real
enthusiasm
for
him


at
amiens

none
at
all
indeed
among
the
middle
classes

and
no
open


display
of
any
on
the
part
of
the
workmen

i
found
the
peasants
for
him


almost
to
a
man

they
crowded
about
his
railway
carriage

they
insisted


on
shaking
hands
with
him

many
of
them
kissed
his
hand

that
ancient


form
of
homage
lingering
still
in
their
traditions


they
fired
off


guns

and

above
all

the
women
held
up
their
children
to
be
kissed
by


him

this
settled
the
question
for
me

when
i
saw
him
kissing
the
little


girls

i
knew
that
he
had
captured
the
mammas

and
the
mammas
govern
the


rural
regions
of
picardy







at
doullens
i
said
to
him


you
may
be
sure
of
your
results
now

you


will
win
by
twenty
five
thousand
majority


he
was
very
modest
about
it



but

though
he
certainly
is
not
a
great
politician

he
seemed
to


understand
the
meaning
of
this
unquestionable
popular
interest
in
him


and
his
progress

i
could
not
help

however

calling
his
attention
to


the
evidence
it
gave
of
what
i
believe
to
be
the
profoundly
monarchical


instincts
of
the
peasantry
in
this
part
of
france








how
did
he
take
it







oh

he
said
nothing

but
smiled
in
a
way
which
might
mean
anything

of


course
his
idea
of
a
republic
of
honest
men
means

and
can
mean

nothing


but
a
republic
with
a
chief
who
is
beyond
the
reach
of
deputies
and


contractors








that


i
said


seems
to
have
been
simply
lafayette
s
idea

in


of


an
american
republic
for
france

with
a
hereditary
executive

or

in


other
words

a
french
edition
of
the
english

republic
with
a
crown








m

fleury
replied

that
this
is
rather
the
aim
of
the
monarchists
than


of
the
boulangists

one
of
general
boulanger
s
lieutenants

m

mermeix



already
cited

told
him
frankly
that
the
boulangists
want
a
sort
of


consulate
stopping
short
of
the
empire

a
strong
republic
with
a


nationally
nominated
chief

freedom
of
conscience

freedom
of
education



no
more
parliaments

a
simpler
public
administration

and
the
cutting


out
of
the
financial
cancer
which
is
destroying
the
resources
of
france



the
coalition
now
existing
between
the
royalists

the
imperialists

and


the
boulangists

in
view
of
the
elections
of


obviously
rests
upon


the
conviction

common
to
all
these
parties

that
the
republic

as
at


present
constituted

is
so
far
committed
to
a
policy
of
reckless
public


expenditure
and
of
deliberately
irreligious
propagandism
that
its


leaders
cannot

if
they
would

either
readjust
the
national
finances
or


let
the
religious
question
alone






a
man
of
much
ability
and
of
very
high
character

who
has
filled


important
financial
posts
under
the
empire
in
this
part
of
france

tells


me
that
there
has
been
no
real
balancing

now

of
the
public
books
for


several
years

because
the
members
of
the
cour
des
comptes
whose
duty
it


is
to
get
this
done
have
found
it
impossible

and
so
reported

to
get


all
the
necessary
accounts
from
the
ministry
of
finance

as
no


conservative
members
are
permitted
to
sit
on
the
committee
of
the


budget

even
such
a
monstrous
thing
as
this
passes
unchecked
by
the


chamber

no
wonder
that
he
should
tell
me

m

bethmont

one
of
the


members
of
the
cour
des
comptes
and
a
republican

is
of
the
opinion
that


nothing
can
make
matters
straight
again
in
france
but
an
emperor
with
a


liberal
constitution

or

in
other
words

a
revival
of
the
ollivier


experiment
of







i
tried
in
vain
to
get
from
m

fleury
some
definite
notion
of
the


political
programme
of
general
boulanger

as
i
have
been
constantly


assured
that
the
general
formed
his
programme
from
his
observation
of


the
institutions
of
my
own
country
during
the
short
time
which
he
spent


in
america

as
one
of
the
chosen
representatives
of
france
during
the


centennial
celebration
of
the
crowning
victory
of
yorktown

in


i


have
long
been
not
unnaturally
curious
to
ascertain
precisely
how
he


proposes
to

americanise

the
actual
government
of
france

but
on
this


point
i
can
get
no
more
light
from
m

fleury
in
picardy

though
m



fleury
spent
some
time
with
the
general
as
a
not
unsympathetic


ally

than
i
have
been
able
to
get
from
any
of
the
general
s
most


devoted
partisans
in
paris

in
picardy
as
in
paris

boulangism
seems
to


represent
a
destructive

or

if
the
phrase
be
more
polite

a


detergent

rather
than
a
constructive
force

it
is
not
the
less
worthy


of
consideration

perhaps

on
this
account

but
on
this
account
it


appears
to
me
more
likely
to
play
a
subordinate
than
a
leading
part
in


the
political
movement
of
these
times

it
is
rather
a
broom

if
i
may
so


speak

than
a
sceptre
which
the

brav

general

is
expected
to
wield

in


conversation
with
m

fleury

another
of
general
boulanger
s
intimate
and


confidential
lieutenants

m

turquet

formerly
an
under
secretary
of


state
in
the
ministry
of
fine
arts

who
ran
for
a
seat
as
deputy
in
the


aisne
in


summed
up
the
programme
of
boulangism
as

a
programme
of


liberty



i
mean


he
said


real
liberty

such
as
exists
in
america



not
our
liberalism

which
is
spurious
and
archaic

our
actual


republicans
of
to
day
are
jacobins

sectarians

their
only
notion
is
to


persecute
and
proscribe

and
they
are
infinitely
further
from
liberty


than
you
royalists
are

for
you
have
at
your
head
a
prince
who
has
a


thoroughly
open
mind

the
form
of
government

after
all

signifies


little

the
real
question
is
not
whether
we
shall
have
a
monarchy
or
an


empire

an
autocracy
or
a
democracy

it
is
whether
we
shall
have


liberty
















m

turquet
ran
in
september
in
the
first
arrondissement
of
the






seine
against
m

yves
guyot

and
there
was
no
election

at
the






election
in
october
the
government
proclaimed
m

yves
guyot
elected






by
a
small
majority







i
answered
him


said
m

fleury


that
what
he
said
was
very
fine

and


that
the
friend
of
fourier

victor
considerant

had
said
it
before
him



what
i
wanted
to
know

however

was

what
the
boulangists
proposed
to
do


with
the
catholics

the
believers

in
france
should
the
general
get
into


power








we
shall
begin


said
m

turquet


by
suppressing
the
budget
of


worship

we
shall
do
this
to
satisfy
the
blockheads
who
are
a
noun
of


multitude







but
we
shall
restore

in
another
shape

to
the
clergy
the
indemnity


which
is
certainly
due
to
them

we
shall
give
the
bishoprics
either
a


fixed
sum

or
a
revenue
proportional
to
the
population
of
each


bishopric

so
that
the
people
may
receive
gratuitously
the
offices
of


religion

this
is
a
public
service

and
it
shall
be
remunerated
as
it


ought
to
be

as
to
the
religious
orders

they
shall
have
full
liberty
to


constitute
themselves

to
educate
children

to
care
for
the
sick
and


infirm

so
long
as
they
keep
within
the
limits
of
the
common
law

all


property
in
mortmain
shall
be
suppressed

a
community
of
teachers

for


instance

may
own
the
college
necessary
for
the
students

but
not
a


forest
adjoining
that
college







to
m

fleury
s
natural
question
how
the
college
should
be
maintained

m



turquet
replied


you
know
as
well
as
i
do

that
wealth
no
longer


consists
in
real
estate
alone

you
can
now
carry
in
your
pocket
a


fortune
in
bonds
payable
to
the
bearer

the
religious
orders
may
own


these

like
other
people

a
dozen
of
us
in
the
chamber
hold
these
views



you
seem
to
think
us
utopianists

but
general
boulanger
will
make
it


possible
for
us
to
apply
these
ideas







if
general
boulanger
and
m

turquet
really
imagine
these
views
to
be



american


it
would
be
instructive
for
them
to
look
into
the
masterly


protests
of
the
catholic
archbishop
of
new
york

against
the
doctrines


of
mr

henry
george
as
adopted
and
expounded
by
father
mcglynn

the


catholic
church
in
the
united
states
holds
its
own
property

real
and


personal

and
manages
it
to
suit
itself

it
would
be
interesting
to
see


an
attempt
made
in
the
legislature
of
an
american
state

to
carry


through
a
law
like
the
decrees
issued
in
france
in


forbidding


curates
and
vicars
to
receive
legacies
left
to
them
for
the
benefit
of


the
poor
in
their
parishes

or
to
distribute
to
the
poor
sums
left
to


the
bureau
of
public
charity

with
an
express
proviso
that
they
should


be
distributed
by
the
clergy
of
the
place






on
one
very
important
question
of
french
politics

m

fleury

as
a


practical
politician
in
this
great
and
active
department

gives
me
a


good
deal
of
useful
light

this
is
the
question
of
the
expenses
of
the


electoral
machine

in
france

as
in
america

no
limit
is
set
by
the
law


to
the
possible
expenditure
of
a
political
candidate

i
have
already


given
the
estimate
made
for
me
in
artois
of
the
general
cost
of
the


legislative
elections

and
i
have
been
told
by
more
than
one


well
informed
french
politician
in
other
parts
of
france

that
the


average
cost
of
a
candidacy
for
a
seat
in
the
chamber
may
be
roughly


estimated
at
twenty
five
thousand
francs

or
a
thousand
pounds
sterling



this
would
show

allowing
two
candidates
only
for
each
seat

an


expenditure
of
thirty
millions
of
francs

or
twelve
hundred
thousand


pounds

at
each
french
parliamentary
election

being
very
nearly
the


figure
given
me
in
artois

we
send
only

members
to
washington

but


we
elect
a
new
house
every
two
years

the
british
house
of
commons



though
more
numerous
even
than
the
french
chamber

probably
spends
a


good
deal
less
upon
getting
itself
elected
than
either
the
french
or
the


american
house















at
this
time

october



there
is
a
difficulty
in
new
york






about
a
good
candidate
for
the
seat
vacated
by
the
death
of
the
late






mr

s

s

cox

being
a
prominent
democratic
member
of
congress







because
the
candidate
must
consent
to
an
annual

assessment

on
his






salary
for
political
purposes

the
french
government

i
am
told







collects
these

contributions

easily

the
deputies

recouping







themselves
by
patronage






one
of
the

working
sub
prefects

of
the
boulangist
party
in
picardy


gave
m

fleury
a
very
frank
estimate
of
the
expense
of
electing
the


general
in


in
the
somme

he
put
it

in
round
numbers

at
nearly
or


quite
one
hundred
and
twenty
five
thousand
francs

or
five
thousand


pounds

this
unusual
outlay
was
made
necessary
by
the
great
efforts
of


the
government
to
defeat
the
general

furthermore

it
was
swollen
by
the


disinterested
devotion
of
many
of
the
general
s
friends

some
of
these


auxiliaries
spent
days
at
the
best
hotels
in
picardy
labouring
for
the


cause

with
the
result
of
a
special
hotel
account

amounting
to
several


thousand
francs

nothing
makes
men
so
thirsty
as
political
emotion



another
partisan

at
the
head
of
a
journal

sent
in
a
bill
for


forty
five
thousand
francs
expended
by
him
upon
printing
and
stationery



no
charge
being
made
for
his
personal
services

the
chief
agents


received
about
two
thousand
francs
apiece

one
of
them
must
have
worked


very
hard

for
he
earned
no
less
than
fifteen
thousand
francs

while
all


this
expense
was
incurring
in
picardy

furthermore

two
other
elections


were
pending

in
each
of
which
the
general
was
a
candidate

one
in
the


charente
and
one
in
the
nord

it
would
seem
to
be
probable
enough



therefore

that
on
these
three
elections
in

general
boulanger

or


the
boulangists

must
have
spent
at
least
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand


francs

or
ten
thousand
pounds







where
did
all
this
money
come
from


is
a
not
unnatural
question

for


m

fleury
tells
me
the
general
s
bills
were
paid
much
more
promptly
than


the
bills
of
the
government
candidates

it
is
an
open
secret
apparently


that
the
government
candidates
are
very
bad
paymasters
when
they
are


beaten

some
of
the
bills
incurred
by
them
in


when
the


conservatives
swept
so
large
a
part
of
northern
france

were
still
due



it
appears

in


but
the
bills
of
general
boulanger
were
settled


very
soon
after
the
close
of
the
campaign






m

mermeix
insisted
to
m

fleury
that
the
general
s
war
chest
was


supplied
by
voluntary
subscriptions


every
day


he
said

the
general


finds
some
ten
thousand
francs
in
his
mails

and
his
followers

are
all


either
beggars
or
millionaires







another
of
the
general
s
managers
gave
m

fleury
the
names
of
two
very


rich
persons

one
of
them
a
cattle
merchant
at
la
villette

who


subscribed
between
them
a
hundred
and
forty
thousand
francs
to
carry
on


the
campaign
in
picardy

the
enormous
importance
given
to
general


boulanger
by
his
terrified
former
associates
in
the
government
seems
to


me
to
be
a
very
striking
proof
of
the
little
confidence
they
really
have


in
their
own
hold
upon
the
country

or
in
the
permanency
of

republican


institutions

as
they
now
exist
in
france

and
this
adequately
explains


the
readiness
of
speculators
to

invest

in
what
may
be
called
the



boulangist
bonds


such
a
report
as
that
presented
not
very
long
ago
to


the
chamber
by
m

gerville
reache
on
the
state
of
the
navy
in
france


suffices
to
show
that
the
speculative
maladministration
of
the
french


finances
has
been
so
great
as
to
make
it
quite
certain
that
any

honest


government

coming
into
power
must
reconstruct
the
system
of
the
public


indebtedness

that
is
an
operation
which
can
hardly
be
carried
out
by


the
most
scrupulously
honest
government
without
very
great
profits
to


the
financiers
concerned
in
it

and
i
only
set
down
what
is
said
to
me


by
respectable
frenchmen
when
i
say
that
the
boulanger
campaign
funds


are
openly
described

by
persons
not
at
all
hostile
to

boulangism


as



bets
on
the
general



the
difference
between
the
managers
of
the


boulangist
campaign
and
the
managers
of
the
government
campaign


said
a


gentleman
to
me
in
amiens


is
simply
this

that
the
boulangist
managers


are
playing
the
game
with
private
funds

and
the
others
with
public


funds

so
the
latter

i
think

will
win

for
they
have
the
longest
purse


to
draw
on


this
gentleman
is
of
the
opinion

however

that
but
for


general
saussier

in
command
of
the
garrison
of
paris

general


boulanger

after
the
election
of
january




in
which
he
took
the


capital
by
storm

might
have
turned
the
government
neck
and
heels
out
of


doors

the
weak
point
of
boulangism


he
said


is
boulanger



he
has


no
strength
with
the
officers
of
the
army

they
have
no
confidence


either
in
his
character
or
in
his
ability

not
that
they
think
his


character
bad
or
deny
his
ability

but
only
that
they
regard
him
as
a


shallow

vacillating

and
mediocre
person
who
made
himself
valuable
to


the
republican
politicians
by
going
into
alliances
with
them
to
which


other
officers
of
strong
character
and
high
ability
would
not
stoop

as


for
the
quarrel
between
boulanger
and
these
politicians

it
is
a


beggars

quarrel

to
be
made
up
over
the
pot
of
broth

but
it
won
t
be


made
up

because
they
can
t
agree
as
to
the
distribution
of
the
broth



meanwhile
all
the
chickens
of
france
are
going
into
the
broth

and
the


peasant
s
pot
will
see
them
no
more

as
in
the
good
old
days
of
henry


iv








as
for
the
absurd
story
that
the
boulangist
funds
come
from
america

the


only
foundation
i
can
find
for
that
seems
to
be
the
intimacy

which

i


believe

is
no
longer
as
close
as
it
was

between
general
boulanger

m



de
rochefort

and
a
french
nobleman
of
an
ancient
historic
family

who


has
married
a
very
wealthy
american
wife

and
who
has
long
been
known
to


entertain
the
most
extreme

not
to
say
revolutionary

notions
in


politics

the
honest
boulangists
who
really
hope
to
see
a
good


government
established
by
putting
out
m

carnot
and
putting
in
general


boulanger

swell
the
tide
of
his
supporters

apparently

here
as


elsewhere
in
france

because
they
blindly
hope
for
everything
from
him


which
their
experience
forbids
them
to
hope
for
from
the
men
actually
in


power

as
one
of
his
most
cynical
supporters
long
ago
said
in
paris

he


is

the
grand
common
sewer
of
the
disgust
of
france







his
popularity
with
the
common
soldiers
is
another
element
to
be
counted


with
in
estimating
the
strength
of
this
military
french
mahdi






i
have
struck
up
a
friendship
here
at
amiens
with
an
excellent
woman
who


presides
over
a
shop

not
one
of
the

patisseries

so
justly
celebrated


by
mr

ruskin

and
who
is
a
very
good
type
of
the
shrewd

sensible


french


petite
bourgeoise



such
a
woman
as

i
dare
say

jacqueline


robins
of
st

omer
was
in
her
own
time

she
has
a
son
in
the
army

who


is
likely
soon
to
be
a
corporal



dame


monsieur


she
said
to
me


if


m

boulanger
is
not
the
best
general
in
france

why
did
they
make
him


minister
of
war

you
do
not
know
what
he
did
for
the
soldiers

my
son


when
he
gets
his
stripes
is
to
marry

she
is
a
very
nice
girl

an
only


child

do
you
know

and
her
father

who
is
very
solid

will
put
her
in


her
own
furniture

and
more
than
that

and
they
will
have
their
own


establishment

they
could
not
have
that

you
know

but
for
general


boulanger

who
made
the
new
rule
about
the
wives
of
the
sub
officers



and
they
used
to
shave
the
soldiers

imagine
it


just
like
prisoners



and
such
beds
as
they
gave
them

it
was
a
horror

well

all
that
he


changed

and
he
made
the
soup
fit
to
eat








the
other
generals
are
not
very
fond
of
him

you
say


parbleu


that


is
likely
enough

it
is
like
the

conseillers

here
in
the
city

one
of


them
does
well

the
others
always
find
something
to
say
behind
his
back



and
that
affair
on
the
frontier

you
know

monsieur

he
had
all
the
army


in
hand

ah

well
in
hand

a
hundred
thousand
men
ready
to
march

and


those
rascals
of
germans
they
knew
it

and
they
gave
up
our
man

i
am


glad
we
had
no
war

no

i
do
not
want
a
war

but


dame


one
must
have


teeth

you
know

and
be
ready
to
show
them








you
want
to
see
your
war
minister
made
president

then


i
asked







president

what
does
that
signify

chief
of
the
state

emperor

ah



those
were
the
good
times
here
in
amiens

monsieur

not
as
it
is
to
day


with
the
eternal
debts
that
m

dauphin
made
us
a
present
of

eh

an
old


hypocrite
that
man
is

and
with
these

centimes
additionnels

that
never


end

and
then
these
water
metres

eh

that
is
a
pretty
invention
to
make


water
as
dear
as
wine
at
amiens

and
yet

god
knows

wine
is
not
too


cheap

with
the
octroi
of
amiens

it
is
worse
than
at
paris

call
him


what
you
like

monsieur


c
est
boulanger
qu
il
nous
faut


that
is
to


say

we
must
have
a
man
at
paris

and
you
will
see
he
is
the
man

all


the
mothers
of
soldiers
will
tell
you
that







from
the
point
of
view
of
the
municipal
finances

the

good
old
times



of
the
empire
may
well
have
a
charm
for
the
taxpayers
of
amiens






in

amiens

with


inhabitants

raised
and
spent
a
municipal


revenue
of
rather
more
than
a
million
and
a
half
of
francs

or

in
round


numbers

about

francs

or

shillings


per
capita

of
the


population

a
public
loan

made
in


had
been
almost
wholly
paid


off

and
the
city
treasury
still
held


francs
of
a
loan
of





francs
made
in

for
certain
public
improvements

the


municipal
government
cost


francs

and


francs
were
spent


on
the
public
schools

of
the
municipal
income



francs
were


derived
from
four
forms
of
direct
taxation

and


francs
from
the



octroi


this
gave
an
average
of
a
little
less
than

francs

per


capita

as
the
burden
of
the

octroi

upon
the
population






in

the
population
had
increased
to



the
direct
taxes
brought


in



francs

and
the

octroi






making
the
average


burden
of
the

octroi
per
capita


fr


c


or
an
increase
of
about



per
cent

in
the
pressure
of
that
form
of
tax
upon
the
population

as


compared
with


as
the

octroi

is
imposed
upon
food
and
beverages


of
all
kinds

fuel

forage

and
building
materials

this
tax
is
regarded


in
france
as
a
measure
for
estimating
the
general
well
being
of
the


inhabitants

thus
measured

there
would
seem
to
be
a
falling
off
in
the


general
well
being
of
the
people
of
amiens
since


for

while
the


pressure

per
capita

of
the
octroi
is
much
greater
than
it
was
in




the
actual
receipts
from
the

octroi

were
less
with
a
population
of




in


than
they
were
in


in

the

octroi

yielded





francs

in

it
yielded
only



francs

the
falling


off
was
in
the
receipts
from
beverages

from
provisions

from
forage



and
from
building
materials

the
tariff
of
the

octroi

meanwhile
has


remained
substantially
without
change
from

to
the
present
time

it


is
an
expensive
tax
to
collect

the
costs
of
collection
in



amounting
to


per
cent

of
the
receipts






adding
together
now
the
receipts
from
the
direct
taxes
and
the

octroi



of
amiens
in


we
have
a
sum
of



francs

or
in
round


numbers
about



francs
more
than
in


but
while

as
i
have


stated

in

the
receipts
equalled
and
balanced
the
expenses
of
the


municipal
government

this
is
no
longer
the
case






in

amiens

with
an
income
of



francs

spent





francs

giving
an
average
municipal
outlay
of

fr


c


per
capita



and
an
excess
of
expenditure
over
revenue
of
no
less
than





francs

or
very
nearly
the
total
income
and
outlay
of
the
city
under
the


empire

no
wonder
that
the
public
debt
of
the
department
of
the
somme



of
which
amiens
is
the
capital

seems
in

to
have
amounted
to





francs

what
inequalities
of
pressure
upon
the
people
of
the


department
this
involves
may
be
estimated
from
the
fact
that

while


there
are
in
the
somme

communes

only


or
less
than
half
of


these
communes

are
authorised
to
raise
money
by
loans

and
one
eighth


of
them
to
raise
money
by

octrois


yet
we
are
constantly
told
that
all


inequalities
and
privileges
were
abolished
throughout
france
by
a
stroke


of
the
pen
in
the

annus
mirabilis





the
taxation
in

communes


is
estimated
at

centimes

or
less

in


at
from

to


in




at
from

to


in


at
from

to


and
in


at

centimes


and
upwards

these
are
the
communal
taxes

to
these
must
be
added



centimes
for
the
departmental
taxes

ordinary
and
extraordinary




centimes
for
the
land
tax


centimes
for
the
personal
tax
and
taxes


on
personal
property



centimes
for
the
doors
and
windows
tax

and




centimes
for
licences

for
amiens
these
fractions
taken
together


mount
up
to



centimes














privileges

were

in
fact

abolished
only
by
napoleon
in







i
have
no
wish
to
weary
myself
or
my
readers
with
figures

but
these


figures
tell
the
story
of
the
difference
between
the
government
of


france
under
the
much
reviled
empire
and
under
the
present
government



which
is
represented
to
us
as
the
natural
and
admirable

evolution

of


republican
institutions
in
this
country

in


as
i
have
stated

the


receipts
and
expenditure
of
the
city
of
amiens
balanced
one
another

the


city
paid
its
way

and
lived
up
to

not
beyond

its
means






with
the
war
came
upon
it

of
course

heavy
and
unexpected
burdens



german
local
exactions

its
share
of
the
general
german
ransom
of


france

local
war
expenses

and
its
share
of
the
general
war


expenditure

for
three
years
the
citizens
left
their
affairs

thus


disturbed
and
encumbered

to
be
managed
by
a
municipal
council
trained


in
the
methodical
habits
of
the
imperial
administration

with
the
result


that
in

the
expenses
of
amiens
amounted
to



francs

and


its
revenues
to



francs

leaving
thus
a
deficit
of




francs

substantially
accounted
for
by
the
necessary
payments
on
a
loan


of



francs
negotiated
in
brussels
by
m

dauphin
at
the
very


high
rate
of



per
cent

the
affairs
of
amiens
were
arranged
three


years
afterwards
by
a
municipal
commission

which
turned
them
over

in




to
the

republicans
of
gambetta


with
a
budget
involving
an


expenditure
of



francs

against
a
revenue
from
taxation
of





fr


c


showing
a
reduced
deficit
of
no
more
than




francs






by

the
expenditure
had
risen
to



francs

while
the
revenue


stood
at




showing
a
deficit
of


francs

being
an


increase
of
nearly
fifty
per
cent

in
two
years

from
that
time
the
gulf


has
gone
on
widening
between
the
receipts
and
the
expenditure
of
the


ancient
capital
of
picardy

until
the
figures
laid
before
me

as
taken


from
the
official
reports

show
during
the
seven
years



a
total


of




francs
of
receipts
against
a
total
of



francs


of
expenditure

leaving
a
deficit
for
these
seven
years
of





francs

or
more
than
the
amount
of
the
dauphin
loan
incurred
by
amiens


as
a
consequence
of
the
german
occupation

and
of
the
exactions
of
count


lehndorff






what
has
been
done
during
the
past
three
years
can
only
as
yet
be


conjectured

the
accounts
are
made
up
at
the
mayoralty
office

and


thence
sent
to
the
prefecture

and
they
do
not
get
within
range
of
the


taxpayer
for
at
least
a
twelvemonth
afterwards






but
m

fleury
assures
me
that
between
the
years

and

the
city


expended
in
buildings

chiefly

scholastic
palaces

erected
as
batteries


of
aggressive
atheism
from
which
to
beat
down
the
temples
of
religion



no
less
than



francs

so
that
the
total
of
deficit
of
the


budget
of
amiens

from

to
the
present
time

in
all
probability


exceeds
six
millions
of
francs






if
we
assume
the
local
finances
of
the
rest
of
france
to
have
been


handled
during
the
last
decade
on
the
same
lines

there
is
nothing


extravagant
in
the
estimate
made
by
a
friend
of
mine

who
formerly
held


a
very
high
post
in
the
treasury

and
who
puts
the
accumulation
of
local


deficits
and
the
local
indebtedness
in
france

independently
of
the


national
deficits
and
the
national
loans

since


at
two
milliards


of
francs

or
eighty
millions
of
pounds
sterling

for

although


amiens
is
an
important
city

it
represents
only
about
one


four
hundred
and
fiftieth
part
of
the
population
of
france






while
i
was
at
amiens
in
june
m

goblet
came
there
and
made
a
rather


remarkable
speech

it
was
in
the
main
aimed
at
a
society
called
the



association
of
the
conservative
young
men
of
amiens


all
of
whom

i
am


told

except
the
president

are
young
working
men

mechanics

clerks

or


the
sons
of
clerks

mechanics

and
working
men

in
short

a
kind
of


french

tory
democracy


they
are
not
boulangists
at
all

but
outspoken


royalists

they
support
boulanger
simply
and
avowedly
in
order
to
get
at


a
revision
of
the
constitution
and
make
an
end
of
the
republic


this


association


said
m

goblet


is
making
a
tremendous
stir

i
admit
its


right
to
do
this

it
holds
meetings
and
conferences

it
listens
to


speeches
in
the
city
and
the
suburbs

it
attacks
both
democracy
and
the


republic
in
no
measured
terms

it
does
not
hesitate
to
denounce
its


enemies
personally
and
by
name

and
neglects
no
means
of
acting
on


public
opinion

these
conservative
young
men
speak
and
act


energetically

they
believe
in
the
re
establishment
of
the
monarchy



they
desire
it

they
preach
a
reaction
against
all
that
we
have
done
for


twenty
years
past







there
could
hardly
be
a
more
signal
proof
given
of
the
reality
and


vitality
of
the
anti
republican
movement
in
this
part
of
france
than


these
words
of
a
republican
leader
who
began
his
political
career

as
i


have
shown

twenty
years
ago
in
a
hopeless
minority
of
republicans
under


the
empire

who
has
since
worked
his
way
up
the
municipal
ladder
at


amiens
and
up
the
legislative
ladder
in
paris

and
who

after
reaching


the
top
of
the
tree

now
finds
himself
in
imminent
peril
of
slipping


down
again
to
the
point
from
which
he
started

the
force
of
the


testimony
is
certainly
not
weakened
by
the
fact
that
at
the
legislative


elections
in
september

m

goblet

standing
as
a
candidate
for
the


chamber

was
completely
beaten






i
have
shown
what
a
large
part
the

octroi

plays
in
the
revenue
of
a


city
like
amiens

nothing
resembling
it

i
believe

exists
in
england


since
the
abolition

two
or
three
years
ago

of
the
coal
dues
in
london



and

though
i
suppose
it
would
be
within
the
power
of
any
american
state


to
establish
a
tax
of
this
sort
within
its
own
boundaries

it
would
be


practically
impossible
to
enforce
it
without
coming
into
collision
with


the
commercial
rights
of
other
states
under
the
federal
constitution

i


once
had
to
pay
the

octroi

tax
on
two
brace
of
maryland
canvas
back


ducks

which
i
was
taking
over
from
london
to
a
christmas
dinner
in


paris

but
maryland
would
not
submit
to
an

octroi

upon
her
birds


entering
new
york






the
importance
of
the

octroi

at
this
time
in
the
financial
system
of


france
is
one
of
the
most
conclusive
and
most
amusing
proofs
of
the


essentially
superficial
and
ephemeral
character
of
the
alleged

great


revolution

of


the

octroi

was
a
revival
in
mediaeval
france
of


the
roman

portorium

which
survives
in
the
italian
offices
of
the



dazio
consume

and
in
the

garitas

of
spain
and
spanish
america

it


was
originally
imposed
as
a
local
tax
by
a
city

under
the
sanction
of
a


royal
charter

to
get
such
a
charter
from
a
sovereign
strong
enough
to


enforce
respect
for
it
was
essential
to
the
citizens
who
bound


themselves
to
one
another
to
maintain
their
local
independence
against


the
barons
in
their
neighbourhood

and
when
such
a
charter
was
granted


by
a
sovereign
it
was
said
to
be

octroyee

by
him

the
tax
therefore
is


rooted
in
a
privilege

amiens
obtained
the
right
to
impose
it
in
the


fourteenth
century

of
course
the

great
revolution
of


swept
this


right
away

one
of
the
most
obvious

rights
of
man

being
to
pluck
an


apple
in
an
orchard

take
it
into
a
town
in
his
pocket

and
eat
it


there

but
equally

of
course

the
republic
in
the
year
vii

on
the
th


vendemiaire
re
established
it

and
in
the
next
year

viii


provided


that
the
privilege
should
be
exercised
as
under
the
sanction
of
the


national
government

the
national
government
reserving
the
right
to


revise
the
tariffs
fixed
by
the
municipal
councils

and
thereby
making


the
restored
privilege
of
the

octrois

another
string
whereby
to
fetter


and
control
the
local
action
of
the
people
on
their
own
affairs

the



octroi

of
amiens
was
re
established
on
the
rd
of
brumaire
next


following

under
the
empire

the
restoration

and
the
monarchy
of
july



the
council
of
state
granted
the

octrois


under
the
republic
of



this
power
naturally
went
to
the
national
assembly
as
a
means
of


legislative
pressure
and
corruption

the
second
empire
restored
it
to


the
council
of
state

and
it
has
now

naturally

gone
back
to
the


chambers

neither
the
people
of
the
cities
nor
the
rural
populations


like
the

octroi


but

in
the
immortal
words
of
the
late
mr

tweed
of


new
york


what
can
they
do
about
it


it
is
a
ready
money
tax

from


which
the
taxpayer
receives
no
visible
equivalent

as
he
does
when
he


pays
a
penny
for
a
postage
stamp

when
he
has
paid
it

he
is
simply


allowed
to
take
his
own
property
where
he
wishes
to
take
it

and
do
with


it
what
he
wishes
to
do

it
is
quite
likely
that
this

octroi

may
have


something
to
do
with
the
disinclination
of
the
common
people
in
france


to
part
with
small
change
as
readily
as
do
the
americans

and
even
the


english

they
must
always
have

money
in
the
pocket

if
they
want
to


bring
a
sausage
and
a
bottle
of
beer
through
a

barrier


whereas
an


american
is
never
called
upon
to
pay
cash
down
to
his
government
except


at
a
custom
house
when
he
returns
to
his
country
from
a
foreign
trip



or
in
exchange
for
a
licence
or
a
document
of
some
sort
which
represents


value
received
in
one
or
another
form






the
time
wasted
over
this
tax
in
a
city
like
amiens
is
an
extraordinary


burden
on
the
patience
of
the
people

trained
as
the
french
people
are


to
submit
to
a
torment
of
eternal
red
tape

a
week
of
which
would
drive


an
american
or
english
town
into
open
revolt

at
amiens

for
example



there
is
a
central
bureau
of
the

octroi


where
the
tax
is
received


from
the
great
breweries
and
warehouses
after
the
amounts
have
been


fixed
by
the
officers
on
duty
at
those
establishments

then
there
are


ten
bureaux
or

barriers

at
the
railway
stations

the
slaughter
houses



and
the
fish
markets

and
then
again
eight
secondary
bureaux

where
the


people
must
go
and
pay
amounts
of
less
than
one
franc

there
are

and
i


am
told
have
long
been

loud
complaints
as
to
the
inconvenient
location


of
the
bureaux

but
nothing
comes
of
these
outcries
as
yet

and
i


presume
nothing
ever
will
come
of
them
until
something
like
an


independent
local
administrative
life
exists
in
the
provinces
of
france






the
elements
of
such
a
life
ought
surely
to
be
found

if
anywhere

in


this
ancient
province
of
picardy

you
cannot
traverse
it
in
any


direction
without
being
struck
by
the
evident
prosperity
of
the
people



arthur
young

a
hundred
years
ago

travelling
from
boulogne
to
amiens



found
only

misery
and
miserable
harvests


he
would
find
now
only


comfort
and
excellent
crops

possibly
he
would
think
of
the
country
what


he
then
thought
of
the
region
about
clermont
and
liancourt

where

under


the
fostering
care
of
the
duc
de
la
rochefoucauld

the
farmers
had


developed
a
highly
diversified
cultivation


here
a
field
of
wheat



there
one
of
luzerne

clover
in
one
direction

vetches
in
another



vines

cherry
and
other
fruit
trees
making
up
a
charming
picture

which


must

however

yield
poor
results







but
he
would
be
wrong

this
diversified
culture
of
modern
picardy
has


been
highly
remunerative

and
the
extensive
kitchen
gardening
of
the


province
is
so
still

the

agricultural
crisis

has
doubtless
hit
the


large
farmers
rather
hard

but
i
am
told
they
are
standing
up
well
under


it

thanks
to
their
past
savings

and
to
french
protection

better



indeed

than
the
large
farmers
in
england

while
the
peasants
proper
are


actually
profiting
by
it

they
not
only
get
as
much
for
their
labour
as


when
the
large
farmers
were
making
money

but
they
are
buying
up
land
at


lower
rates

this
may
very
possibly
help
the
republicans
in
the
coming


elections

for
the
peasants
always
give
the
credit
of
a
state
of
things


which
is
satisfactory
to
them
to
the
government
of
the
day

be
that


government
what
it
may

so
that
while
the
larger
farmers
tend
to


conservatism

the
peasants
will
probably
lean
the
other
way

it
is
next


to
impossible
to
get
a
political
opinion
out
of
a
picard
peasant

but
i


have
more
than
once
heard
a
peasant
speak
of
the
farmers
in
his


neighbourhood
as

aristocrats


which
i
took
to
be
as
precise
a
formula


of
political
opinion
as
one
was
likely
to
get
from
him

it
seemed
to
me


to
represent

among
the
peasants
of
to
day

the
enlightened

principles


of



very
much
as
the
same
formula

applied
to
the

noblesse

of
a


century
ago

represented

among
the
large
farmers
of
that
day

the



principles
of








both
then
and
now
the
formula
simply
means

the
man
who
has
what
i
want


to
have
is
an
aristocrat


i
think
i
have
observed
something
like
this


in
other
countries

as

for
example

in
ireland

where
the
guilty


possessor
of
acres

however

is
not
only
an

aristocrat

but
an

alien




as
appears
from
a
song
popular
in
kerry










the
alien
landlords
have
no
right






to
the
land
god
made
for
you





so
we
ll
blow
them
up
with
dynamite







the
thieving

hellish
crew






dynamite
was
unknown
in
picardy
a
century
and
a
half
ago

and
the
picard


has
very
little

except
his
religion

in
common
with
the
irish
celt

but


the
sentiment
of
this
simple
and
pleasing
little
ditty
glowed
deep
in


the
picard
heart
long
before
the
revolution
of


the

earth
hunger




which
has
given
the
act
of

land
grabbing

the
first
place
in
the


category
of
human
crimes

invented

long
ago
in
picardy

and
especially


in
that
part
of
picardy
now
known
as
the
department
of
the
somme

a


custom
called
the

coutume
de
mauvais
gre

or
the

droit
de
marche




under
this
custom
a
tenant
farmer
in
picardy
considered
himself
entitled


to
sell
the
right
to
till
his
landlord
s
fields
to
anybody
he
liked

to


give
it
as
a
dowry
to
his
daughter

or
to
leave
it
to
be
divided
among


his
heirs

and
all
this
without
reference
to
the
expiration
of
his


lease

if
the
landlord
objected
and
went
so
far
as
to
lease
his
land
to


another
person

the
previous
tenant
was
regarded
by
his
friends
and
by


other
farmers
as
a

depointe


entitled
to
take
summary
vengeance
upon


the

land
grabber


he
might
kill
off
his
cattle

burn
his
crops
and
his


buildings

and

if
occasion
served

shoot
or
knock
him
in
the
head

as


the
whole
country
was
in
a
conspiracy

either
of
terror
or
of
sympathy



to
protect
the

depointe

against
the
vengeance
of
the
law

this


cheerful

custom

had
a
liberalising
effect
upon
the
picard
landholders



rents
fell

and
if
the
value
of
landed
property
rose
the
landed


proprietor
got
no
advantage
from
that

the
torch
and
the
musket
kept


down
the
demand

which
was
equivalent
practically
to
increasing
the


supply

the
results
of
this

custom

were
such
that
in


a
quarter


of
a
century
before
the
revolution
of


the
king
intervened

but
in


vain

to
put
a
stop
to
it

the

oppressed
and
downtrodden
peasant

of


picardy
under
the

ancien
regime

did
what
he
liked
with
his
neighbour
s


property

that
neighbour
being
a
landlord

as
cheerily
as
the
manacled


celt
of
mayo
or
tipperary
in
our
own
times

two
years
before
the


revolution

in


the
assembly
of
the
generality
of
amiens

by
its


president
the
duc
d
havre

vainly
urged
the
royal
government
to
take


resolute
action
in
this
matter

with
the
revolution

of
course

things


grew
worse
very
rapidly

the

depointes

became
ardent
lovers
of


liberty

equality

and
fraternity

tore
up
all
their
leases

sent
their


landlords
and
the
land
grabbers
to
the
guillotine

or
into
emigration
as


traitors

and
made
themselves
proprietors

in
fee
simple

there
seems
to


be
no
doubt
that
the
traditions
of
this

coutume
de
mauvais
gre


which


obviously
had
much
more
to
do
with
the
politics
of
picardy
a
century
ago


than
either
voltaire
or
rousseau

still
survive
in
the
department
of
the


somme

and
every
now
and
then
break
out
in
agrarian
outrages



rick
burnings

and
general
incendiarism

whenever
leases
fall
in
and


landlords
try
to
raise
their
rents
on
the
shallow
pretext
that
land
has


risen
in
value






while
these
traditions
show
that
there
was
no
lack
of
energy
and
force


among
the

downtrodden

picard
peasantry
before
the
revolution
of




the
local
history
of
the
province
also
proves
that
the
liberal
ideas


which
are
commonly
supposed
to
have
been
introduced
into
france
by
the


revolution
were
at
work
in
picardy
among
the

noblesse

and
the
clergy


long
before

the

corvee


for
example

of
which
we
hear
so
much
in


many
so
called
histories
of
the
french
revolution

was
abolished
under


louis
xvi

in
picardy

before
the
states
general
of

were
convened






that
the

corvee


in
itself

cannot
have
been
the
absolutely


intolerable
thing
it
is
commonly
supposed
to
have
been
may
be
inferred



i
think

from
the
fact
that

under
the
name
of

prestation
en
nature




it
still
exists
in
many
parts
of
the
french
republic

it
figures
in
all


the
schedules
of
departmental
taxation
which
i
have
seen
down
to
the


year


and

for
that
matter

it
existed
in
new
england
down
to
a


very
recent
date

if
it
does
not
now
exist
there

it
was
obviously


liable
to
abuse

and
doubtless
was
abused

and
the
intendant
of
picardy



m

d
aguay

made
a
striking
speech

on
the
benefits
to
be
expected
from


its
abolition

to
the
provincial
parliament
in


from
this
speech
we


learn
that
the
money
value
of
the

corvee

in
hand
had
been
computed
at




livres

but
that
the
intendant
working
out
the
details
of
the


abolition
of
the
system

with
the
help
of
a
number
of
the
local


landholders

commonly
supposed
to
have
been
the
tyrants
who
profited
by


the
abuse


had
reduced
this
estimate
to


livres

at
which
sum


the
tax
had
been
converted
into
a
money
payment
for
the
maintenance
of


the
roads

the
province
being
thus
relieved
of
two
thirds
of
the
burden


borne
by
it

it
is
instructive
to
learn
that
attempts
to
bring
about


similar
results
elsewhere
in
france
were
resented
and
resisted

not
by


the
great
landholders

but
by
the
corveable
peasants
themselves

what


they
really
wanted

it
would
seem

was
not
so
much
to
be
relieved
of
the


obligation
of
forced
labour
by
a
payment
of
money

as
to
have
their


roads
made
for
them
at
the
expense
of
the
state

under
the
impression



ineradicable
down
to
our
own
day

and
elsewhere
than
in
france

that


what
everybody
pays
nobody
pays

an
impression
which
is
the
trusty


shield
and
weapon
at
once
of
the
socialists
and
of
the
protectionists


all
over
the
world






public
education
in
picardy

as
well
as
elsewhere
in
france

long


antedates
the
revolution
of


three
centuries
ago
olivier
de
serre


and
bernard
palissy
lamented
the
foolish
disposition
of
french
peasants


in
the
limousin
and
in
picardy
to
give
their
elder
sons
a
better


education
than
they
had
themselves
received


the
poor
man
will
spend
a


great
part
of
what
he
has
earned
in
the
sweat
of
his
brow

to
make
his


son
a
gentleman

and
at
last
this
same
gentleman
will
be
ashamed
to
be


found
in
company
with
his
father

and
will
be
displeased
to
be
called


the
son
of
a
labouring
man

and
if
by
chance
the
good
man
has
other


children

this
gentleman
it
will
be
who
will
devour
the
others
and
have


the
best
of
everything

he
never
concerns
himself
to
think
how
much
he


cost
at
school
while
his
brothers
were
working
at
home
with
their


father


this
reads
like
a
complaint
of
the
nineteenth
century
in


democratic
america

but
it
is

in
fact

a
complaint
of
the
sixteenth


century
in
feudal
france

it
must
have
been
frequent
enough
in
this
part


of
picardy

now
the
department
of
the
somme

for
from
a
very
early
time


this
region
has
been
full
of
small
farmers
bent
on
bettering
their
own


condition
or
that
of
their
sons

in
the
public
library
of
abbeville


there
is
a
land
register
drawn
up
in

for
the
service
of
the


officers
of
king
edward
ii

of
england

who
had
married
isabel
of


france

from
which
it
appears
that
the
small
tenants
in
this
part
of


picardy
were
then
as
numerous
as
the
small
proprietors
now
are


one
is


led
to
believe


says
m

baudrillart


that
the
only
difference
between


the
condition
of
the
country
then
and
now
in
this
respect
is

that
the


enfranchised
labourer
has
in
many
cases
simply
taken
the
place
of
the


feudal
tenant
and
become
proprietor
of
the
soil


so
great
has
long


been
the
number
of
small
landholders
in
picardy
that
in
the
province



taken
generally

a
holding
of
sixty
hectares
may
pass
for
a
large


property

one
of
fifteen
for
a
moderate
estate

and
one
of
ten
for
a


small
holding

the
action
of
the
french
code
upon
this
state
of
things


since
the
revolution
and
the
empire
has

in
the
opinion
of
many


intelligent
observers

been
mischievous

it
has
made
it
difficult
to


check
the
excessive
subdivision
of
the
land
into
holdings
too
small
to


be
profitably
and
intelligently
cultivated

there
is
no
provision
in
the


french
law
it
seems

as
there
is
in
the
german
law

making
it
obligatory


upon
the
heirs
of
a
small
landed
property
so
to
arrange
their
respective


shares
as
not
to
impede
the
proper
cultivation
of
the
land

the
great


prosperity
of
kitchen
gardening
in
modern
picardy
modifies
the
evils


flowing
from
this
state
of
things
however

and
those
who
know
the


country
best
tell
me
that

taken
as
a
body

the
small
landholders
of


picardy

thanks
to
their
thrift
in
regard
both
of
time
and
of
money

are


substantially
well
off

they
don
t
like
the
townspeople

for
the
old


traditions
are
not
yet
forgotten
of
the
time
in
which
amiens
and
the


other
large
towns
used
to
shift
the
main
burden
of
the
expenses
of
the


province
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
peasantry

and
if
anything
like
a


genuine
provincial
legislature
could
be
established

with
a
working


system
of

home
rule


all
the
elements
are
here
which
might
be


developed
into
a
healthy
political
activity

the
system
of
working
on


france
from
the
centre
at
paris
to
the
circumference
has
certainly
been


tried
long
enough

and
thoroughly
enough

to
show
that
nothing
but
evil



and
that
continually

can
be
expected
from
it






more
than
fifty
years
have
passed
since
heine
said


when
i
speak
of


france
i
speak
of
paris

not
of
the
provinces

just
as
when
i
speak
of


a
man

i
speak
of
his
head

not
of
his
legs

to
talk
about
the
opinion


of
the
provinces
is
like
talking
about
the
opinion
of
a
man
s
legs







in
this
spirit
france
is
still
judged
abroad

for
in
this
spirit
france


is
still
governed
at
home

but
if

on
some
fine
morning

the
legs
should


suddenly
wake
up
with
a
very
positive
opinion
of
their
own

the
results


may
be
awkward

not
only
for
the
government
at
paris
but
for
the
rest
of


europe















chapter
vii





in
the
aisne










st

gobain





the
short
railway
journey
from
amiens
on
the
somme
to
la
fere
on
the


oise
takes
you
through
a
country
which

on
a
fine
summer
s
morning



reminds
one
of
the
old
kentuckian
description
of
an
agricultural


paradise


tickle
it
with
a
hoe

and
it
laughs
with
a
harvest


as

in


one
direction

picardy
extends
into
the
modern
department
of
the


pas
de
calais

so
in
other
directions
it
includes
no
inconsiderable
part


of
the
modern
departments
of
the
oise
and
of
the
aisne

in
this
way
it


touches
the
central
province
of
the
ile
de
france

the
main
body
of


which
is
now
divided
into
the
three
departments
of
the
seine

the


seine
et
oise

and
the
seine
et
marne

from
amiens
to
la
fere



therefore

the
pulse
of
the
french
capital
may
be
said
to
throb
visibly


about
you
in
the
rural
beauty
of
a
region
which
owes
its
value
and
its


fertility
less
to
the
natural
qualities
of
the
soil
than
to
the


quickening
influences
of
the
great
metropolis

for
centuries
paris
lived


mainly
on
the
ile
de
france

and
the
ile
de
france
on
paris

since
the


steam
engine
and
the
railway
have
opened

both
to
the
province
and
to


the
capital

the
markets
of
all
france
and
of
all
europe

both
the


province
and
the
capital
are
infinitely
more
prosperous
than
in
the
old


days
when
the
lack
of
communications
and
the
lawlessness
of
men
made


them
dependent
one
upon
the
other

the
steppes
of
russia
and
the


prairies
of
america
now
compete
with
the
grain
fields
of
the


ile
de
france

the
timber
of
the
baltic
with
its
timber

and
i
have
no


doubt
that

during
his
six
years
in
the
prison
of
ham

louis
napoleon


drank
there
better
chambertin
than
ever
found
its
way
to
the
table
of


the
grand
monarque
at
versailles

after
a
certain
enterprising
peasant


walked
all
the
way
from
his
native
province
to
the
capital

beside
his


oxcart
laden
with
casks

to
prove
to
the
king
the
merits
of
the
true


burgundian
vintage






certainly
it
would
never
occur
to
anybody
now
in
soissons
or
laon
to


make
the
journey
to
paris

as
people
did
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago



to
drink
the
water
of
the
seine

as
being

the
best
in
the
world

and
a


specific
against
burning
fevers
and
obstructive
ailments







but
the
vast
commons
which
lay
waste
throughout
the
ile
de
france
a


hundred
years
ago
are
now
green
with
crops

meadows
have
replaced
the


marshes

orchards
and
gardens
on
every
side
show
what
the
campagna
of


rome
may
become

at
no
distant
day

if
italy
can
make
her
peace
with
the


church

and
the
italian
capital
remain

on
terms
of
justice
and
reason



the
capital
of
the
catholic
world






before
the
revolution
the
generality
of
paris
contained


arpents


of
waste
commons

the
generality
of
soissons


arpents

in

a


writer
deplores
the
spectacle


within
thirteen
leagues
of
the
capital



of
vast
marshes
left
to
be
inundated
because
they
are
common
lands



producing
not
a
single
bundle
of
hay
in
a
year

and
affording
scanty


pasture
to
a
few
miserable
cattle


in
a
single
hamlet
this
writer
found



poor
families
feeding

cows
and

sheep
on


arpents
of


common
land

i
believe
there
are
philanthropists
in
england
and
scotland


who
think
the
enclosure
and
cultivation
of
common
lands
a
crime
against


humanity

and
it
would
be
edifying
to
listen
to
a

conference

between


them
and
the
shrewd

prosperous
small
farmers
and
gardeners
who
are


tilling
these
great
spaces
to
day
in
the
ile
de
france

one
of
the
few


plainly
advantageous
results
of
the
headlong
revolution
of

was
the


transfer
into
many
private
hands
of
the
immense
estates
which
were
held


by
the
abbeys
and
the
clergy
in
and
around
paris

and
this
transfer


might
perfectly
well
have
been
brought
about
by
steady
and
systematic


means
without
shaking
the
foundations
of
property
and
of
order

we
might


then
have
seen
throughout
france
what
we
see
in
england

the
gradual
and


pacific
evolution
of
a
great
industrial
and
commercial
society
on
lines


not
contradicting

but
conforming
to

the
traditions
of
the
nation






the
influence
of
the
capital

of
course

has
had
much
to
do
with
the


extraordinary
development
in
these
regions
of
all
kinds
of
horticulture



nurseries

kitchen
gardens

flower
gardens
occupy
an
increasing
area
of


the
ile
de
france

and
a
constantly
growing
proportion
of
its


inhabitants

m

baudrillart
says
that
in
the
single
department
of
the


seine
et
oise
this
proportion
has
increased
tenfold
since


and
he


puts
it
down
for
that
department
in

at


persons
out
of
a


total
population
of








the
proportions
can
hardly

i
should
think

be
much
smaller
in
the


departments
of
the
aisne
and
of
the
oise

how
much
this
industry
adds
to


the
beauty
of
the
country
i
need
not
say

its
influence
is
shown
in
a


notable
increase
of
the
love
of
flowers
among
the
population
generally



the
english
villages
no
longer
have
the
monopoly
which
they
certainly


once
had
of
flower
plots
before
and
around
the
cottages

and
of
plants


carefully
tended
and
blooming
in
the
cottage
windows

years
ago
dickens


used
to
say
that
london
was
the
only
capital
in
the
world
in
which
you


could
count
upon
seeing
something
green
and
growing
somewhere

no
matter


how
gloomy
otherwise
might
be
the
quarter
into
which
you
strolled

this


is
beginning
to
be
true
of
not
a
few
french
towns
and
cities

while
the


conditions
of
successful
horticulture

in
its
various
branches

give
the


aspect
of
a
garden
to
the
rural
regions
in
which
it
flourishes

the


nursery
gardens

which
are
the
most
extensive

seldom
cover
more
than


eight
hectares

seed
gardens
range
in
extent
from
half
a
hectare
to
a


hectare

the
fruit
gardens
from
half
a
hectare
to
two
hectares

the


gardeners
who
send
up

cut
flowers

to
market
usually
concentrate
their


activity
upon
half
a
hectare
of
soil

these
cultivators
are
all


capitalists
in
a
small
way

the
least
important
of
them
requiring
a


capital
of
from
four
to
five
hundred
pounds
sterling

and
land
so


employed
is
very
often
let
on
leases
of
three

six

or
nine
years

at


thirty
five
pounds
a
hectare






it
is
a
curious
thing
that
what
may
be
called
the

home
departments

of


france
around
paris
should
be
so
much
richer
in
these
highly
developed


and
remunerative
forms
of
cultivation
than
the
home
counties
of
england


around
london

why
should
flowers

fruits

and
vegetables

as
a
rule

be


so
much
better

so
much
cheaper

and
so
much
more
plentiful
in
the


french
than
in
the
english
capital

the
superiority
of
the
french


markets
cannot
arise
wholly
from
a
difference
of
climate

great
risks


are
run
in
this
respect
by
the
horticulturists
of
picardy
and
the


ile
de
france

m

baudrillart
tells
a
story
of
a
large
flower
gardener


in
the
seine
et
oise
who

during
the
severe
winter
of



found
his


gardens
deep
in
snow
one
morning

and

upon
examining
them

carefully


made
up
his
mind
that
he
stood
to
lose
nearly


l


sterling
worth


of
his
best
plants

that
same
evening
he
left
for
england

brought
back


eleven
waggon
loads
of
plants
to
supply
the
place
of
those
killed
by
the


cold

and

by
the
spring

not
only
covered
his
losses
but
made
a
profit






with
its

polygon

and
its
promenades
the
little
city
of
la
fere

set
in


the
midst
of
well
tilled
and
fertile
fields

has
a
martial
air
which


harmonises
with
its
history

during
the
religious
wars
which
ended
with


the
coronation
of
henry
of
navarre

this
small
catholic
stronghold
was


besieged

taken

and
retaken
no
fewer
than
four
times
in
twenty
years



and

if
we
may
believe
an
old
sixteenth
century
local
ballad

the


huguenots
behaved
in
a
way
which
showed
that
the

reformation

had
not


improved
their
morals

the

deploration
des
dames
de
la
ville
de
la
fere


tenues
forcement
par
les
ennemis
de
la
religion
catholique

draws
a


doleful
picture
of
life
in
a
conquered
city
three
centuries
ago

there
are
soldiers
enough
in
la

to

for
it
is
an
artillery


station

as
it
was
when
napoleon
got
his
training
here

but
the
peace
of


the
picturesque
little
fortress
town
is
less
troubled
by
them
than
by


the
politicians

a
little
local
newspaper
published
here

which
i
bought


of
an
urchin
at
the
uninviting
but
thriving
station
of
tergnier

was


full
of
paragraphs
deriding
and
denouncing
the
clergy

which
might
have


been
inspired
by
that
model
patriot
and
philanthropist
curtius

who


proposed
in
the
year
one
of
the
republic
that
the
government
should
make


a
bargain
with
the
deys
of
tunis
and
algiers
to
ransom
the
french
held


as
slaves
in
those
countries

exchanging
them
for
french
priests

at
the


rate
of
three
priests
for
one
patriot








what
sort
of
a
newspaper
is
this


i
asked
a
cheery

red
faced
old
man



well
and
substantially
dressed

and

as
he
afterwards
informed
me

a


cattle
breeder
and
dealer
on
his
way
from
amiens
to
laon







that
journal

monsieur


he
replied
with
a
kind
of

sniff



that
leaf



it
is
a
cabbage
leaf

monsieur



c
est
une
feuille
de
choux


as
for


himself
he
was
a
republican

no

not
a
boulangist

but
he
had
voted
for


boulanger

and
he
would
vote
for
him
again

there
must
be
an
end
of
all


those
taxes

it
was
too
strong

the
land
could
not
pay
them

in
his


country
a
farm
worth


francs
eight
years
ago

to
day
would
not


sell
for


francs

the
farms
that
were
mortgaged
would
not
pay
the


amount
of
the
mortgages

look
at
the
taxes
on
cattle

these
free
traders


at
paris
want
to
drive
us
out
of
our
markets
with
meat
on
the
hoof

and


killed
meat

from
all
the
ends
of
the
world

here
they
are
trying
to


patch
up
that
treaty
of
commerce
with
italy

and
bring
back
all
those


competing
cattle
from
sardinia

that
s
a
pretty
idea

and
for
those


italians

who
owe
france
everything
and
now
lick
the
boots
of

and
now
the

wants
an
international


congress
on

of

the
devil
take
the
treaties
of


commerce







at
the
station
of
la
fere
i
found
waiting
for
me

one
lovely
morning
in


july

the

coupe

of
m

henrivaux

the
director
of
the
famous
and


historical
glassworks
of
st

gobain

when
arthur
young
visited
these


works
in


he
found
them
turning
out

in
the
midst
of
extensive


forests


the
largest
mirrors
in
the
world


the
forests
are
less


extensive
now

but
st

gobain
still
turns
out
the
largest
mirrors
in
the


world

to
this
year
s
exposition
in
paris
it
has
sent
the
most
gigantic


mirror
ever
made

showing
a
surface
of


metres

and
the
glory
of


st

gobain
is
nightly
proclaimed
to
the
world
at
paris
by
the
electric


light
which

from
the
summit
of
the
eiffel
tower

flashes
out
over
the


great
city
and
the
valley
of
the
seine
an
auroral
splendour
of


far
darting
rays

thanks
to
st

gobain
and
to
the
largest
lens
ever
made


by
man






st

gobain

however

has
other
claims
upon
attention
than
its


unquestioned
rank
as
the
most
important
seat
of
one
of
the
most


characteristic
and
important
manufactures
of
our
modern
civilisation

in


a
most
interesting
paper
upon
the
life
and
labours
of
m

augustin


cochin

one
of
the
most
useful
as
well
as
one
of
the
most
distinguished


of
the
many
useful
and
distinguished
frenchmen
whose
names
are


associated
with
this
great
industry

m

de
falloux
describes
the
works


of
st

gobain
as

an
industrial
flower
upon
a
seignorial
stalk
springing


from
a
feudal
root







the
description
is
both
terse
and
pregnant

the
history
of
this
great


and
flourishing
industry

stretching
back
now
over
two
centuries
and
a


half

is
a
history
of
evolution
without
revolution






there
is
nothing
in
france
more
thoroughly
french
than
st

gobain



nothing
which
has
suffered
less
from
the
successive
parisian
earthquakes


of
the
past
century

nothing
which
has
preserved
through
them
all
more


of
what
was
good
in
its
original
constitution
and
objects

the


establishment
is
like
a
green
old
oak

and

to
borrow
a
phrase
from


wordsworth

its
days
have
been
joined
each
to
each

by
natural
piety




the
place
which
it
first
took
through
privilege
and
favour

and
could


have
taken
in
no
other
way

it
has
kept
ever
since
for
nearly
two


centuries
and
a
half

and
now
holds
by
virtue
of
skill

energy

and
that


eternal
vigilance
which
is
both
the
price
and
the
penalty
of
free


competition






the

knights
of
labour

in
our
america
of
to
day
put
the
cart
before
the


horse
when
they
undertake
to
make
labourers
knights

the
middle
ages


knew
better

and
went
to
work
in
a
wiser
fashion
by
making
knights


labourers

as
early
as
the
thirteenth
century
the
glassworkers
of
france


had
great
privileges
granted
them

and
an
old
proverb
explains
this
by


telling
us
that

to
make
a
gentleman
glassworker


un
gentilhomme


verrier


you
must
first
get
a
gentleman


as
soon
as
it
was
established


that
by
going
into
such
a
costly
and
artistic
industry
as
this

a


gentleman
did
not
derogate
from
his
rank

the
first
important
step
was


taken
towards
the
emancipation
of
industry

the
glassworkers
were


exempted
from

tailles

aydes
et
subsides


from

ost

giste



chevaulchier
et
subventions


or

in
other
words

military
taxes
could


not
be
levied
upon
them

nor
troops
quartered
upon
them

nor


requisitions
made
upon
them

the

gentilhomme
verrier

had
the
right
to


carry
a
sword
and
to
wear
embroideries

to
fish
and
to
hunt

nor
could


the
lord
of
a
domain
refuse
to
him

in
return
for
a
small
fee

the
right


to
cut
whatever
wood
he
needed
for
his
furnaces

and
to
collect
and
burn


the
undergrowth
into
ashes
for
his
manufacture

it
was
the
richly
and


densely
wooded
country
about
st

gobain
which
led
to
the
establishment


at
this
spot
in

of
the
glassworks
since
developed
into
the
great


establishment
of
our
day

even
now

though
gas
has
long
since
taken
the


place
of
wood
in
the
manufacture

and
towns
and
farms
have
grown
up
in


the
neighbourhood

no
less
than


hectares
of
the


which
make


up
the
territory
of
st

gobain
proper
are
still
in
woodland

and
the


forests
extend
far
beyond
the
limits
of
the
commune
which
bears
the


name
of
the
irish
catholic
prince
st

gobain

who
came
here
in
the


seventh
century

as
st

boniface
went
to
the
rhine

to
evangelise
the


country

and
built
himself
a
cell
on
the
side
of
the
mountain
which


overlooks
the
glassworks

here
he
did
his
appointed
work

and
here

on


june




he
was
put
to
death

the
mountain
was
then
known
as
mount


ereme
or
mount
desert

and
it
is
still
heavily
wooded
throughout
almost


its
whole
extent






the
french
government
also
owns
a
very
large
domain
around
and
beyond


st

gobain

about
two
thirds

i
am
told

of
the


hectares


constituting
thirteen
per
cent

of
the
whole
area
of
the
department
of


the
aisne

which
are
still
covered
with
forests



these
ten
thousand


hectares
are
the
remnant
of
the
immense

sylvacum

of
the
laonnois

the


andradawald
of
eastern
gaul

through
which
agrippa
opened
a
great
roman


road
connecting
the
capital
of
the
world
by
way
of
milan

narbonnese


gaul

reims

and
soissons
with
the
british
channel

at
a
short
distance


from
st

gobain
a
part
of
this
ancient
road
running
from
south
to
north


through
the
lower
forests
of
coucy

is
still
in
use

and
is
known
by
the


name
of
queen
brunehild
s
causeway

the
chronicle
of
st

bertin

cited


by
bergier

attributes
to
that
extraordinary
woman
the
restoration
of


this
whole
road
throughout
gaul

and
she
certainly
built
a
magnificent


abbey
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood













the
total
revenue
derived
from
the
woods
and
forests
of
the






state
in
france
is
set
down
in
the
budget
for

at









francs

but
the
returns
are

lumped

and
not
given
in
detail

i
am






told
that
the
forests
around
st

gobain
yield
about


francs






of
this
revenue






encouraged
by
the
wise
administration
of
colbert

an
association
of


glassworkers
established
itself
at
st

gobain
in

under
the


direction
of
a

gentleman
glassworker


m

du
noyer

twenty
years


afterwards

in


a
norman

gentleman
glassworker


m

lucas
de


nehou

who
had
joined
this
association

invented
the
process
known
as


the

coulage

of
glass
for
mirrors

and
this
became
the
kernel
of
the


great
industry
of
st

gobain

the
association
took
the
name

in


of


the
thevart
company

from
de
nehou
s
most
active
colleague

it
became


the
plastrier
company
in


and
ten
years
afterwards

in


m



geoffrin

the
husband
of
the
clever
and
enterprising
friend
of
voltaire


and
the
empress
catherine

took
charge
as
administrator
of
the


establishment

his
wife
really
administered
both
the
establishment
and


m

geoffrin

it
was
she
who
confided
the
direction
of
the
works
in



to
m

deslandes

and
she
is
fairly
entitled
to
her
share
of
credit
for


the
great
progress
made
in
the
subsequent
half
century
down
to




under
the
first
consulate
st

gobain
had
to
give
up
the
privileges
it


had
enjoyed
and
face
the
modern
conditions
of
success

it
has
proved
its


claim
to
its
ancient
privileges
by
its
triumphs
ever
since
it


surrendered
them

the
history
of
its
relations
with
the
crown
and
with


the
courts
under
the

ancien
regime

is
a
most
curious

interesting

and


instructive
chapter
of
the
political
and
social

as
well
as
of
the


industrial

annals
of
france

and
it
has
been
admirably
told
by
m



augustin
cochin
in
his
book
on
the
manufactory
of
st

gobain
from



to







a
drive
of
less
than
an
hour
through
a
highly
cultivated
rolling


country

made
attractive
by
well
grown
trees
and
luxuriant
hedgerows



brought
me
to
the
clear

bright

prosperous
looking
town
of
st

gobain



its
two
thousand
inhabitants
owe
their
well
being

in
one
form
or


another

to
the
great
company

and
among
the
most
comfortable
as
well
as


the
most
picturesque
dwellings
in
the
place
are
the
houses
built
by
the


company

and
conceded
on
very
favourable
terms
to
the
families
of
men


employed
in
the
works

piles
of
timber
attested
the
activity
of
the


forest
administration

the
people
i
passed

singly
or
in
groups

saluted


the
director
s
carriage
in
a
friendly

good
natured
way

which
seemed
to


show
that
here

at
least

the

irrepressible
conflict

between
capital


and
labour
has
not
yet
passed
into
the
acute
stage

a
fine
old
church
of


the
thirteenth
century

with
a
tower
of
the
sixteenth

and
the
noble


trees
which
cover
the
slopes
and
shade
the
roadway
of
st

gobain

are
no


more
in
keeping
with
the
standard
english
and
american
type
of
a


manufacturing
town
than
is
the
parklike
domain
in
the
midst
of
which


rise
the
main
buildings
of
the
great
manufactory
itself






there
m

henrivaux
gave
me
a
cordial
welcome

the
chateau
of
st

gobain



in
which
the
offices
of
the
company
have
long
been
established

is
a


vast
square
edifice
of
the
time
and
the
style
of
louis
xiv

it
occupies


the
site

and

i
believe

comprises
one
remaining
wing
of
an
earlier


chateau

which
was
stormed
and
partially
destroyed
by
the
english
in
the


fourteenth
century

henry
iv

was
seigneur
of
st

gobain

and
when
the


glassworks
company

at
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century

bought
the


domain
and
the
buildings
from
the
count
de
longueval

then
governor
of


la
fere

the
title
of
the
crown
to
the
property
had
to
be
extinguished


as
well
as
his






nothing
can
be
finer
in
its
way
than
the
wide
panorama
of
forest
clad


hills
and
rolling
vales

dotted
here
and
there
with
towns

villages

and


chateaux

over
which
you
gaze
from
the
terrace
in
front
of
this
unique


establishment

it
has
its
pleasure
grounds
and
its
park

within
the
main


building

besides
the
extensive
suite
of
apartments
assigned
to
the


director

who
resides
there
with
his
family

is
another
handsome
suite


of
apartments

reserved
for
the
administrators

six
in
number

whenever


they
may
choose

collectively
or
severally

to
visit
st

gobain

these


apartments
are
furnished
with
stately
simplicity

and
the
whole
interior


preserves
the
grand
air
of
the
eighteenth
century

the

fleurs
de
lis



still
adorn
the
lofty
chimney
pieces

the
waxed
floors
are
sedulously


polished

and

as
m

henrivaux
says

could
the
ghost
of
lucas
de
nehou


have
returned
to
st

gohain
only
a
year
or
two
ago

he
would
have
been


welcomed
at
the
entrance
gate
by
a
swiss
wearing
the
royal
liveries
of


the
house
of
bourbon

and
resting
majestically
on
his
halberd

like
the


guards
of
the
scala
regia
in
the
vatican

this
imposing
warden
has
now


passed
away

at
the
ripe
age
of
a
hundred
and
two

and
m

henrivaux


tells
me
that
he
was
more
alert
and
active
to
the
last
than
his
more


celebrated
contemporary
at
paris

the
venerable
chevreuil






when
a
new
administrator
first
makes
his
appearance
at
st

gobain

i
am


told

he
is
received
with
music
by
day
and
an
illumination
at
night

a


grand
mass
is
celebrated
in
the
chapel
dedicated
to
the
royal
irish


martyr

and
the
whole
place
assumes
for
a
moment
the
aspect
of
another


age






in
one
of
the

salons

of
the
administration

two
pictures
commemorate


visits
paid
to
the
manufactory

one

under
the
restoration

by
the


duchesse
de
berri

the
mother
of
the
count
de
chambord

the
other

under


the
second
empire

by
the
empress
eugenie

pathetic
pictures
both



making
the
room
a
place
wherein
to

sit
upon
the
floor
and
tell
strange


stories
of
the
deaths
of
kings







beside
the
canvas
in
which
the
empress
appears

a
graceful

gracious


woman
in
the
prime
of
her
life
and
her
beauty

hangs
a
small
mirror
in
a


gilded
frame

silvered
by
her
own
imperial
hand
in
the
great
workroom


of
the
manufactory

the
work
was
well
and
deftly
done

but
so
delicate


is
the
process
that
when
the
light
strikes
athwart
this
mirror
at
a


particular
angle

you
can
clearly
trace
a
faint
hair
line
of
shadow


traversing
it

the
ineffaceable
record
of
a
ripple
of
laughter
which


broke
from
the
empress
s
lips
at
some
gay
remark
made
by
one
of
the


personages
grouped
about
her
while
her
hand
was
completing
its
task






i
spent
a
delightful
day
with
m

and
mme

henrivaux

inspecting
all


parts
of
the
manufactory
of
mirrors

visiting
the
houses
provided
for
a


considerable
number
of
the
workmen
and
their
families

on
terms
most


advantageous
to
them
by
the
company

and
inquiring
into
the
working
of


the
co
operative
association
founded
by
m

cochin






this
association
is
an
association
of
consumers
only

not
of
producers



its
original
statutes
were
drawn
up
very
carefully
by
m

cochin

and
as


they
have
been
as
carefully
observed
by
the
members
and
the
managers

it


is
the
opinion
of
m

henrivaux
that
the
experiment
has
proved
to
be
a


success

this
may
be
inferred
from
the
fact
that
the
title
of



co
operative

has
been
assumed
in
the
town
of
st

gobain
by
a
bakery



which
seems
to
be
managed
on
the
principles
of
private
competition
under


the

co
operative

flag

if
the

trademark

were
not
popular

it
would


hardly
have
been
assumed






the
company
also
encourages
societies
among
its
own
workmen
and
in
the


town
for
educational
purposes

including
a
philharmonic
and
a
choral


society

and
is
liberal
in
its
expenditure
upon
the
schools

both
here


and
at
chauny

the
seat
of
its
very
important
chemical
works






at
st

gobain
alone

i
understand

it
is
now
making
an
outlay
of
some


sixty
thousand
francs
on
new
school
buildings

which
is
a
larger
sum


than
the
total
of
the
taxes
paid
by
the
people
of
the
place

the



budget

of
the
commune
amounts
to


francs

or
rather
more
than


ten
francs

per
capita

of
the
population

obviously
the
prosperity
of


the
glassworks
makes
the
prosperity
of
st

gobain

which

but
for
them



would
doubtless
soon
relapse
into
the
proportions
of
the
little
hamlet


gathered

twelve
hundred
years
ago

by
the
irish
evangelist
about
the


miraculous
fountain

which
is
said
to
have
been
evoked
by
him
with
a


blow
of
his
staff

and
which
still
flows
beneath
the
shelter
of
his


church






when
arthur
young
visited
st

gobain
a
hundred
years
ago
he


congratulated
himself
on
his

good
luck

in
hitting
upon
a
day
when
the


furnaces
were
in
full
blast
and
the

coulage

going
on

a
traveller
of


the
present
day
who
should
reach
st

gobain
armed
with
the
letters
of


introduction
necessary
to
secure
his
admission
into
the
works

and
find


the
furnaces
not
in
full
blast
and
the

coulage

not
going
on

would
be


in
very
bad
luck
indeed






for
while
in

st

gobain
was
a
privileged
company

enjoying

for
the


output
of
its
works
here
and
in
normandy

and
in
the
faubourg


st

antoine
at
paris

a
chartered
monopoly

the
output
of
its
works


to
day

under
the
wholesome
pressure
of
competition
with
a
fair
field


and
no
favour

is
enormously
greater
than
it
was
a
century
ago

both
in


volume
and
in
value

and
the
position
of
st

gobain
among
the
glassworks


of
the
world
is
at
least
as
high
under
the
presidency
of
the
duc
de


broglie

in


as
it
was
under
the
presidency
of
the
duc
de


montmorency
in


yet
the
company
is
still
administered

not
indeed


according
to
the
letter
of
its
original
statutes
of
the
time
of
the


grand
monarque

but
in
the
spirit
of
those
statutes

it
is
an
ancient


dynasty
which
has
simply
accepted
the
changed
conditions
of
modern
life


and
modern
activity

and
conformed
its
operations
to
them
without


abandoning
its
fundamental
principles

the
successful
advance
of
this


great
industry

through
all
the
changes

convulsions

and
developments


of
the
past
century

is
quite
as
instructive
as
are
the
successive


catastrophes
of
french
politics
during
the
same
time


i
think


said
m



henrivaux
to
me


that
when
you
compare
the
st

gobain
of

with
the


st

gobain
of


you
will
perhaps
agree
with
me
that
there
is
some


force
in
our
double
motto


tradition
dans
le
progres
et
heredite
dans


l
honneur







it
is
a
curious
fact
that
lucas
de
nehou

the
inventor
of
plate
glass



was
originally
induced
by
the
founders
of
st

gobain
to
leave
his
own


establishment
at
tour
la
ville
in
normandy
and
come
to
their
works
in


paris

because
the
venetian
glassworkers
who
had
been
invited
by
colbert


into
france

refused
to
instruct
the
french
workmen
in
their

art
and


mystery


they
could
not
be
blamed
for
this

venice
was
then
the


acknowledged
headquarters
of
the
glass
manufacture

and
it
was
the


unchangeable
policy
of
the

most
serene
republic

to
keep
all
her


secrets
to
herself

a
fundamental
statute
ordained
that
if
any
artisan


or
artist
took
his
art
into
a
foreign
country
he
should
be
ordered
to


return

if
he
did
not
obey

his
nearest
relatives
were
to
be
imprisoned



in
order
that
his
affection
for
them
might
lead
him
to
submit

if
he


submitted

his
emigration
should
be
forgiven

and
he
should
be


established
in
his
industry
at
venice

if
he
did
not
submit

a
person


was
sent
after
him
to
kill
him

and
after
he
was
well
and
duly
killed


his
relatives
were
to
be
released

in
the
thirteenth
century
venetian


artists
suffered
death
under
this
statute
in
bologna

florence

mantua



and
other
italian
cities

even
in
venice
the
glassworks
were
rigidly


confined
to
the
island
of
murano

in
order
to
keep
the
workmen
from


coming
into
contact
with
strangers
visiting
the
city

when
the
republic



in


as
a
matter
of
policy
allowed
a
certain
number
of
glassworkers


to
go
to
france

at
the
request
of
colbert

and
to
take
service
there


under
du
noyer
at
paris

in
his
manufactory
of
mirrors

these
workmen


were
forbidden
to
teach
their
trade
to
any
frenchman

the
result

as
i


have
said

was
that
du
noyer
finally
brought
about
a
combination
with
m



de
nehou

the
owner
of
certain
glassworks
at
tour
la
ville
in
normandy



that
de
nehou
came
to
paris

that
out
of
their
joint
enterprise


eventually
arose
the
company
now
known
as
the
company
of
st

gobain



that
the
french
workmen
trained
by
de
nehou
did
excellent
work

and
that


de
nehou
put
himself
in
the
way
of
making

towards
the
end
of
the


seventeenth
century

his
invention
of
plate
glass

which
finally
drove


venetian
mirrors
out
of
the
markets
of
the
world

the
venetian
mirrors



charming
as
they
are
from
the
aesthetic
point
of
view
of
decorative
art



are
simply
blown
glass
rolled
flat

cut

polished

and
tinned

the
art


of
making
them
came

like
other
arts

to
venice
from
the
east

and
in


the
sixteenth
century
the
venetian
mirror
was
the
true

glass
of


fashion

all
over
europe

the
famous

galerie
des
glaces

at
versailles



of
which
louis
xiv

was
so
proud

was
filled
up
with
mirrors
of

french


manufacture
after
the
fashion
of
venice


as
the
royal
expense
rolls


state

and
it
took
de
nehou
and
his
workmen
five
years

from

to




to
do
the
work

eight
years
afterwards

in


he
presented
king


louis
with
certain

large
mirrors
of
plate
glass


the
firstfruits
of


his
invention

made
in


in


he
was
made
director
of
the

royal


manufactory
of
grand
mirrors


and
the
manufactory
was
established
in


the
ruined
chateau
de
st

gobain






a
hundred
years
afterwards

in


napoleon
bonaparte
occupied
venice


with
a
french
army
and
made
an
end
of
that

most
serene

republic

as
he


did

not
long
afterwards

of
the
least
serene
republic
at
paris

he
put


berthier
in
command

and
a
commission
of
french
savants

of
which


berthollet
was
a
member

proceeded
to
pick
the
locks
and
investigate
the


mysteries
of
venetian
art

their
report
upon
the
venetian
glassworks
was


to
the
effect
that
france
knew
more
about
the
matter
than
venice


the


industries
of
venice


said
these
irreverent
conquerors


as
precocious


as
the
industries
of
china

have
stood
still
like
them







in
this
age
of
jointstock
companies
and
limited
liabilities

it
may
be


interesting
to
see
on
what
terms
the
original
founders
of
the
company
of


st

gobain
put
their
heads
and
their
purses
together

to
establish
a


great
industrial
enterprise

their
articles
of
association
were
signed


by
twelve
associates
on
february




some
ten
years
after
william


paterson
and
lord
halifax
laid
the
foundations
of
the
bank
of
england


and
of
the
british
public
debt

the
capital
of
the
company

estimated
at





livres

was
divided
into
twenty
four
shares
of


livres


each

called

sols


and
these
again
into
twelve
parts
each

called



deniers


making
a
total
of


deniers


these
curious
designations



taken
from
the
currency
of
the
time

were
used
down
to
the
overthrow
of


the
restored
bourbon
monarchy
in


the
owners
of
these
shares

or



deniers


bound
themselves
solemnly
never
to
make
a
loan

but
to
meet


all
the
expenses
of
the
enterprise
by
assessments
in
proportion
to
their


holdings

and
always
to
keep
in
hand
a
fund
for
current
expenses
of
at


least
one
million
of
livres

they
were
to
receive
ten
per
cent

on
their


capital

a
special
honorarium
of


livres
a
year
apiece

and
a
fee


of
two
crowns
for
attendance
at
meetings

all
misunderstandings
were
to


be
settled
by
arbitration

and
all
the
proceedings
were
to
be
secret



under
these
articles
st

gobain
grew
up

prospered

withstood
the
shock


of
successive
political
revolutions
in
france

and
kept
its
place
in
the


front
of
the
great
industrial
movement
of
the
nineteenth
century
down
to


the
year







during
this
long
life
of
over
a
century
and
a
quarter

the
payment
of


dividends
seems
to
have
been
suspended
for
three
years
only

and
that


after
the
terror

from

to


in


when
the
girondins
and
the


jacobins
were
tearing
france
to
pieces
between
them

and
courting


foreign
invasion
as
a
stimulus
to
domestic
anarchy

the
works
were


stopped
for
a
time
in
paris

at
tour
la
ville
and
at
st

gobain

but


only
for
a
time

the
very
able
director
of
the
company

m

deslandes



originally
selected

as
i
have
said

by
madame
geoffrin

and
who
had


vindicated
her
good
judgment
by
managing
the
affairs
of
the
company
with


success
for
thirty
years

resigned
his
post
in


he
was
a
model


disciplinarian
of
the
old
school






in


finding
that
some
of
the
workmen
at
tour
la
ville
had
been


seduced
from
their
duty
by
a
glassmaker
at
la
fere
en
tardenois

m



deslandes
called
upon
the
intendant
at
soissons
to
clap
them
into


prison

turgot

the
friend
of
franklin

objected
to
this

but
m



deslandes
gave
him
plainly
to
understand
that

a
government
which
should


tolerate
such
misconduct
would
be
detestable







when
a
great
mirror
was
to
be
cast
at
st

gobain

m

deslandes
always


took
command
of
the
works
in
full
dress

his
peruke
well
powdered
and


his
sword
by
his
side

clearly
such
a
director
as
this
was
out
of


keeping
with
a
king
who
would
not
let
his
officers
fire
upon
a
howling


mob

and
who
put
on
a
red
cap
to
oblige
a
swarm
of
drunken
ruffians






m

deslandes
was
followed
into
retirement
by
several
of
the


administrators
of
the
company

who
emigrated

and
in

the
republic


caused
the
cashier
of
the
company

m

guerin

to
be
guillotined
on
the


heinous
charge
of
corresponding
with
his
former
employers
and
friends


beyond
the
frontier

naturally
this
crime
was
committed

like
so
many


similar
crimes
of
that
day

with
an
eye
to
the
main
chance

the
shares


of
the
administrators
who
had
emigrated
were
confiscated

in
the
names


of
liberty

equality

fraternity

and
the
confiscators
sent
sundry



patriots

to
sit
on
the
administrative
council
of
the
company

their


incompetency
was
so
ludicrous
and
mischievous
that
robespierre



representing
the
state
which
had
thus
stolen
an
interest
in
the


enterprise

could
not
stand
it

he
actually

requisitioned

two


noblemen

two

aristocrats


among
the
as
yet
undisturbed
owners
of
the


property

to
come
forward
and
direct
it

just
as
the
leader
of
a


successful
mutiny
of
convicts
on
board
of
a
transport
might



requisition

the
deposed
captain
and
mate
of
the
vessel
to
carry
her


safely
through
a
storm






with
the
return
of
law
and
order
in
the
person
of
the
corsican
conqueror


things
resumed
their
normal
course
at
st

gobain

and
as
i
have
already


said

the
company
flourished
under
its
old
organisation
down
to
the


establishment
of
the
monarchy
of
july

then
the
owners
of
the

deniers



put
themselves
and
their
property
under
the
general
civil
code

in
the


form
of
what
is
called
in
modern
france
a

societe
anonyme


and
at
the


first
general
meeting
of
the

societe

in
april

the
accounts
of



years

over
which
no
question
had
ever
arisen
among
the
representatives


of
the
original
holders

were
presented
and
approved

certainly
this


must
be
admitted
to

the

has
greatly
extended
and
strengthened
its
operations


since


the
works
at

have
been
abandoned

the

sold

and
the

transferred
to
st

the
glassworks
of


st

the
proprietors
of
which

on
the
abolition
in

of


privileges
in
general

had
taken
to
making
plate
glass

were
taken
over


in

by
the
st

company

together
with
certain
other
works
at


mannheim
in
germany
and
the
chemical
works
at
cirey

and
the

assumed
the

under
which
it
is
now
known
of

the
company
of
mirrors


and
chemical
products
of
st

gobain

chauny

and
cirey


in

it


bought
up
the
works
at

near

la

in

prussia



in

a
minor
manufactory
at
montlucon
in
the
department
of
the


allier

and
finally
during
this
current
year

it
is
establishing
a


manufactory
at

in

the
operations
of
the
company

as
it
now
exists

extend
to
six


manufactories
of

the
finest

used


in

here

as
i
have
said

the
lens
was
made


now
used
at
the
top
of
the
eiffel
tower
in
paris

from
which

night


after
night

a
gigantic
auroral
ray
of
electric
light
leaps
into

and
shoots
for
miles
athwart
the

to
the
inexpressible
delight
of


the
gaping
crowds
below

and
i
hope
to
the
edification
of
the
world
of


science






since

the
output
of
the
company
from
its
various
manufactories
has


more
than
doubled

it
now
amounts

in
round
numbers

to


square

and
to

of
all
sorts






in
the
time
of
louis
xiv

and
before
lucas
de
nehou
had
made
his


invention
of
plate
glass

there
was
absolutely
no
public
demand
for
what


in
those
days
were
called

large
mirrors

made
in
the
venetian
fashion



mirrors
which
to
day
would
not
find
a
market
in
the
most
remote
frontier


towns
of
america
or
australia

colbert
then
wrote
to
the
comte
d
avaux


apropos
of
the
works
of
lucas
de
nehou
in
normandy

that

there
was


absolutely
no
market
for
large
mirrors
in
the
kingdom

the
king
being


the
only
person
who
could
possibly
need
them







this
was
in







in


ten
years
after
the
invention
of
the
process
by
which

when

come
down

fall
in

is
extraordinary

in

a

can
be

to

from
this
it
will
be
seen
that
nearly
one
quarter
of
the
plate
glass
of


a
world
in
which
plate
glass

like
champagne

is
rapidly
ceasing
to
be
a


luxury
and
becoming
a
necessity

is
produced
at
this
ancient


establishment

with
a
keen
perception
of
the
tendencies
of
this
age


st

gobain

of
late
years

has
been
fitting
its
machinery
to
produce
the


very
largest
plates
of
glass
possible
to
be
made

go
where
you
like



from
the
eden
theatre
in
paris
to
the
casino
of
monte
carlo

from
the


new
monster
hotel
at
the
gare
st

lazare
to
the
enormous
edifice
which


an
enterprising
firm
of
tradesmen
has
planted
in
the
centre
of
the
corso


at
rome

and
the
vast
glittering
sheets
of
silvered
glass
turned
out


from
the
great
forges
everywhere
confront
you

at
the
french
exposition


of

st

gobain
enabled
the

fly
gobblers

of
two
hemispheres
to


admire
themselves
in
the
most
gigantic
mirror
ever
made
down
to
that


date

it
measured
six
metres
and
a
half
in
height

by
four
metres
and


eleven
centimetres
in
width

which
gave
it
a
surface
area
of

metres



centimetres

naturally
m

henrivaux
determined
to
surpass
this


prodigy
in


and
to
match
the
eiffel
tower
with
a
mirror

the


belgian
rivals
of
st

gobain
suspected
this

it
seems

and
sent
forth


subtle
persons
to
spy
out
the
plans
of
the
great
french
manufactory



these
colossal
plates
of
glass
are
cast
upon
immense

tables

of
metal



and
by
ascertaining
the
dimensions
of
the
tables
ordered
for
st

gobain


the
ingenious
belgians
hoped
to
get
the
measure
of
the
effort
it
would


be
necessary
for
them
to
outdo

in
anticipation
of
this
subtlety
the


director
of
st

gobain
ordered
two
immense
tables

and
when
these
were


sent
to
the
manufactory

had
them
skilfully
thrown
into
one

upon
the


gigantic
table
thus
prepared
the
grand
mirror
of
the
exposition
of



was
cast
at
the
eleventh
hour

this
mirror
was
the
special
delight
of


the
shah
of
persia
during
his
visit
of
this
year
to
paris

and
as
i


suppose
the
seven
plate
glass
manufactories
which
have
grown
up
in
my


own
beloved
country
under
the
benediction
of
the
protective
tariff



since
a
prohibitive
duty
was
originally
clapped
on
plate
glass
to


encourage
the
one
solitary
establishment
of
the
sort
then
existing
in


america

will
give
themselves
up
to
producing
something
more
stupendous


still
for
the
new
york
exposition
of


i
here
set
down
its


dimensions

it
measures
in
height

metres

centimetres

and
in
width



metres

centimetres

giving
it
a
superficial
area
of

metres



centimetres

it
is

millimetres
thick

and
weighs

kilogrammes



this
enormous
glass
was
cast
from
a
single
crucible

containing




kilogrammes
of
vitreous
matter

to
have
seen
this
operation
would
have


been
worth
a
very
much
longer
journey
than
that
from
new
york
to


st

gobain

for
the
colour
and
glow
of
such
a
mass
of
vitreous
matter
in


fusion
can
only
be
matched
by
the
evanescent
hues
of
a
crimson
aurora
on


a
fine
night
in
the
north

or
by
the
intense
lights
which
play
over
the


surface
of
a
stream
of
molten
lava






at
every
stage
in
the
operation
the
utmost
skill
and
delicacy
of


handling
are
required
to
convert
what
might
easily
pass
for
a
heap
of


rubbish
swept
together
from
a
macadamised
roadway
into
the
smooth



glittering

lustrous
plate
which
the
french
so
picturesquely
call
a



glace


and
which
indeed
most
nearly
resembles
the
evenly
frozen


surface
of
a
crystal
lakelet

these
sands

silicates

chalks

and


carbonates

rough
contributions
from
oken
s

silent
realm
of
the


minerals


are
first
crushed
and
mingled
together
by
machines

one
of


the
best
of
them

i
was
glad
to
hear

of
american
invention

then
passed


on
into
the
great
rectangular
hall

in
which
they
are
shot
into
the


crucibles
of
the
melting
furnaces
and
fused

mainly
by
gas

on
a
system


invented
and
perfected
by
the
late
dr

siemens

i
believe

who
made
such


a
stir
a
decade
ago
at
glasgow
by
his
discourse
on
the
storage
of
force


before
the
british
association

the
furnaces
which

according
to
their


varying
capacity

now
require
from
eight
to
ten
tons
of
coal
a
day



consumed

before
the
development
of
the
siemens
system

from
sixteen
to


twenty
tons

twenty
four
hours
now
suffice
for
the
fusion
and
the


casting
of
the
glass

and
if
the
casting
were
now
to
be
conducted
as


ceremoniously
as
in
the
time
of
that
fine
old
martinet
m

deslandes

m



henrivaux
would
pass
his
life
in
a
cocked
hat

knee
breeches

peruke



embroidered
coat

and
sword

for
the
casting
now
takes
place
every
day


and
at
a
fixed
hour

none
the
less

rather
the
more

it
is
a
work
still


of
extreme
nicety

one
to
be
done
by
experts

who
must
be
as
cool
as


soldiers
under
fire

in
a
certain
way
and
measure
it
is
like
ladling
out


the
molten
lava
of
vesuvius
and
pressing
it
into
slabs
for
a
lady
s


toilette
table

the
plates

once
cast

must
be
smoothed
and
made
even



this
is
a
very
pretty
process

and
used
to
be
performed
by
machines


which
bore
the
very
pretty
names
of

valseuses


that
paviour
s
rammers


should
be
called

demoiselles

has
always
seemed
to
me
an
outrage
and
an


impertinence

though
i
may
suppose
it
finds
its
excuse
in
the


short
waisted
costumes
of
our
grandmothers

but
the
movement
of
the


glass
smoothing

valseuses

was
really
a
sort
of
waltz
movement

the


plates
of
glass
were
fixed
with
plaster
on
a
solid
rectangular
table



granite
dust
was
scattered
upon
the
plates

and
then
a
wooden
plateau



armed
on
the
under
side
with
bands
of
cast
iron
or
steel

was
set
to


waltzing
over
it
backwards
and
forwards
with
a
semi
rotatory
motion

the


granite
dust
supplied
becoming
finer
and
finer
as
the
waltzing
went
on






instead
of
these

valseuses

two
great
plates
of
glass
are
now
fixed


side
by
side
with
plaster
on
huge
tables

and
two
large
ashlars
are
set


turning
by
steam
on
their
own
axes
while
they
describe
a
great
orbit


over
the
plates
of
glass

a
stream
of
water
constantly
plays
upon
the


plates

which
are
also
constantly
powdered
with
fine
sand

the
ashlars


turn
on
their
axes
thirty
or
forty
times
a
minute

and
the
plates
of


glass
are
usually
smoothed
and

evened

on
both
faces
now
by
these


machines
in
from
eight
to
nine
hours

including
the
time
spent
in
taking


them
out
of
the
plaster
after
one
face
has
been
smoothed

and
fixing


them
anew
in
the
plaster

that
the
other
face
may
fare
as
well

here


again
a
considerable
economy
of
time
has
been
made

and

after
all

when


one
looks
into
the
practical
production
of
any
of
these
great
marvels
of


human
industry

it
is
in
this
economy
of
time
that
the
real
advance
of


modern
science
beyond
the
results
of
ancient
invention
seems
to
consist



with
all
our
nineteenth
century
chorus
of

self
praising



self
admiring


where
should
we
be
if
certain

for
the
most
part



uncertain
and
forgotten

men
of
genius
had
not
invented
the
primordial


processes
which
made
art
and
civilisation
possible

the
workshop
came


first

and
was
the
real
marvel
in
the
case
of
every
great
industry

to


talk
of
the

invention

of
the
steam
engine

for
example

is
an


absurdity

the

invention

was
the
engine

an
invention
as
old
as
egypt


or
china

the
discovery
that
steam
could
be
made
to
work
the
engine
is


the
more
modest
modern
achievement

in
this
industry
of
glass
making
the


amazing
thing
is
that
it
should
have
come
into
the
mind
of
a
man
so
to


apply
the
heat
of
burning
wood
to
sands
and
silicates
enclosed
in
an


earthen
vessel
as
to
convert
them
into
an
entirely
new
substance


possessing
qualities
not
perceivable
by
any
human
sense
in
the
sands



the
silicates

or
the
earth






what
our
modern
progress
in
chemistry
and
in
mechanics
has
enabled
the


makers
of
glass
to
do

is
greatly
to
reduce
the
trouble
and
cost
of


producing
this
entirely
new
substance

greatly
to
improve
the
quality
of


the
substance
produced

and
to
extend
the
range
of
the
uses
to
which
it


can
be
applied






what
would
the
egyptians

who
paid
their
tribute
in
glass
to
rome

have


thought
of
a
serious
order
to
pave
the
via
sacra
with
blocks
of
purple


glass

yet
such
an
order
could
be
executed
now
at
st

gobain

and
when


one
sees
the
great
flags
weighing
nine
kilogrammes
made
here
and
used
to


let
light
into
the
cellarage
below
the
carriage
ways

for
example

of


the
huge
hotel
continental

at
paris

it
comes
easily
within
the


probabilities
that
the
whole
underworld
of
our
great
cities
in
time
may


thus
come
to
be
made
available
for
divers
uses

as
so
much
of
the


underworld
of
broadway
now
is
in
new
york






the
great

pavement
question

is
an
open
question
still

in
spite
of


asphalte
and
of
wood

and
there
would
seem
to
be
nothing
in
the
nature


of
things
to
prevent
its
being
eventually
solved
by
the
glassworkers



the
roofing
question
clearly
belongs
to
them

the
casting
of
glass
for


roofs
began

i
believe

with
england

in
the
time
of
sir
joseph
paxton



but
it
has
been
immensely
developed
at
st

gobain

over
a
hundred


thousand
square
metres
of
glass
roofing
made
here
were
required
for
the


building
of
the
exposition
of
this
year
at
paris

all
the
most
important


railway
stations
in
france

from
nantes
to
strasburg

unless
the
germans


have
changed
this


and
from
calais
to
marseilles

are
thus
roofed

in


great
warehouses

markets

public
museums

street
galleries

like
those


of
victor
emmanuel
at
milan

factories

workshops
all
over
france
and


the
continent

this
conversion
of
the
roof
into
a
colossal
window
has


revolutionised
matters
within
the
last
twenty
years

the
light
is
making


its
way
even
into
turkey

where
the
great
bazaar
at
salonica
has
been


roofed
in
glass
by
st

gobain

and
as
the
chinese

who

despite
their


early
invention
of
glass

never
got
beyond
using
it
for
beads
and
little


bottles

have
condescended
to
admit
great
french
mirrors
into
the


imperial
palace
at
pekin

the
glass
roof
may

ere
long

make
its
way


even
into
china






in
the
form
of
tiles

such
as
are
now
made
here

glass
must
inevitably



sooner
or
later

displace
slates
and
shingles
and
terra
cotta
for
the


roofs

even
of
private
houses

it
being
quite
certain
that
these
glass


tiles
can
be
so
used
as
to
give
a
much
better
light
in
the
garrets
of


private
houses
than
can
possibly
be
got
through
the
windows

when
that


comes
to
pass
the
burglar
s
occupation
of
clambering
stealthily
from


roof
to
roof
will
be
seriously
interfered
with

what
with
glass
roofs


and
glass
floors
and
electricity

indeed

the
city
of
the
future
is


likely
to
be
much
more
easily

policed

and
patrolled

as
well
as


incomparably
more
cheery
and
habitable

than
the
city
of
to
day



perhaps

too

when
we
all
come
to
living
in
glass
houses

the
cause
of


peace
and
good
neighbourhood
may
gain

and
even
mrs

grundy
may
grow


more
careful
about
looking
into
the
affairs
of
her
friends
and


acquaintances






if
that
much
maligned
potentate
the
emperor
nero
had
any
real
notion
of


the
capabilities
of
glass
when
he
established
the
first
glassworks
at


rome

the
lamentation
with
which
he
took
farewell
of
the
world



qualis


artifex
pereo



may
have
been
inspired
by
regret
at
his
not
being


allowed
time
enough
to
develop
them

certainly
such
gigantic
mirrors
as


those
which
st

gobain
has
this
year
sent
to
the
exposition
would
have


shown
to
better
advantage
in
his
colossal

golden
house

than
in
any
of


our
petty
modern
palaces

in
what
palace
in
england
or
in
france
to
day


could
a
mirror
measuring

metres
x

centimetres
in
height
by

metres


x

centimetres
in
width

and
thus
displaying
a
surface
of
more
than



square
metres

be
placed

without
dwarfing
everything
about
it

these


immense
and
magnificent
mirrors
must
go
hereafter
to
decorate
palaces
of


public
resort


palaces
of
the
people


not
palaces
of
princes

what
was


a
royal
luxury
when
colbert
wrote
to
d
avaux
in

has
become
a


popular

the
smallest
restaurant
in
paris
would
think
itself


discredited
to
day
were
it
decorated
with
one
of
the

grandes
glaces



for
which
colbert
in

thought
st

gobain
would
find
no
purchaser


save
the
king

but
the
grand
cafe
and
the
hotel
terminus
of
the
gare


st

lazare
order
mirrors
in

which
no
king
of
our
times
would
very


well
know
what
to
do
with






yet

once
more

how
the
cost
of
these
mirrors
has
fallen

in

a


plate
glass
mirror
showing
two
square
metres
only
by
surface

cost

at


st

in

such
a
mirror

showing
four

metres
of

at
st

francs

a
mirror
showing


ten
square
metres
of
surface

which
could
not
have
been
made
in

at


any
price

can
now
be
had
for

francs






in


under
napoleon

a
mirror
showing
four
square
metres
of
surface


cost


francs

or
very
nearly
three
times
the
present
cost
of
a


mirror

not
tinned
like
the
mirrors
of


but
silvered

of
twice
and


a
half
that
size

while
new
markets
are
constantly
opening
to
this
great


industry
all
over
the
world

the
progress
of
chemical
science
and
of


mechanics
is
as
constantly
suggesting
new
economies
and
new
improvements


in
the
manufacture
of
glass

and
st

gobain

though
one
of
the
most


thoroughly
french
of
all
french

institutions


shows
no
chauvinism
in


its
incessant
study
and
prompt
appropriation
of
these
economies
and


these
improvements

during
the
invasion
of

the
workmen
of


st

gobain
marched
off
to
chauny
to
resist
the
advance
of
the
prussians



and
the
manufactory
had
to
pay
a
heavy
fine
for
its
patriotism

but
it


avails
itself
as
readily
of
german
as
of
french
science
to
day

and
i


found
m

henrivaux
entirely
and
minutely
familiar
with
the
very
latest


phenomena
of
the
great
change
which
is
coming
over
the
glassworks

as


well
as
all
the
other
industries

of
pittsburg

through
the
use
there
of


natural
gas
instead
of
coal
gas
and
coal

all
the
most
recently
invented


furnaces

english

german

american

have
been
tried
and
tested
here
as


soon
as
they
were
made

and
the
latest
american

crushers

and



regulators

get
to
st

gobain
as
soon
as
they
do
to
pittsburg

the


materials
which
go
to
the
making
of
a
plate
glass
mirror
pass
through


seven
processes
before
the
original
heap
of
pebbles

dust

and
ashes
is


transformed
into
a
sheet
of
splendour
and
light






a
hundred
years
ago
more
than
ten
days
were
required
to
complete
these


seven
processes

from
the
crushing
and
mixing
and
putting
into
the


furnace
of
the
soda
and
the
silicious
sand
and
the
charcoal
and
the
lime


and
the
broken
glass

called
here

calcin


through
the
fusion

and
the


moulding

and
the
squaring

and
the
smoothing

and
the
washing

and
the


polishing

now
this
is
all
done
in
half
the
time


hours
instead
of









with
all
this
the
condition
of
the
workmen
employed
at
st

gobain
has


also
steadily
improved

it
seems
always
to
have
been
good

relatively
to


the
general
conditions
of
workmen
in
other
industries
and
other


establishments
in
france

under
the
original
statutes

and
in
the
time


of
the
excellent
m

deslandes

the
nominee
of
madame
geoffrin

who
ruled


st

gobain
with
great
success
from

down
to
the
revolution

the


workmen
of
st

gobain

as
i
have
shown

were
looked
after

as
well
as


kept
to
their
duty

on
strictly
patriarchal
principles

not
likely
to


find
favour
in
modern
eyes

that
they
did
not
themselves
dislike
the


system
may
be
inferred
from
the
fact
that
no
such
thing
as
a
strike
has


ever
been
known
at
st

gobain

and
that
a
considerable
proportion
of
the


workmen
employed
here
now
are
the
direct
descendants
of
workmen
employed


here
in
the
last
century

there
are
even
workers
by
inheritance

as
men


may
be
soldiers
and
sailors
or
magistrates
by
inheritance

of
course


with
the
great
extension
in
our
own
time
of
the
operation
of
the


company

great
numbers
of
workmen
other
than
glassworkers
have
come
into


its
employment

but
in
the
glass
manufactures
alone
there
are
now


employed

at
st

gobain

workmen

at
chauny


at
cirey
sur
vezouze




at
montlucon


at
stolberg

in
rhenish
prussia



at
waldhof



in
baden
baden



making

in
all









the
wages
of
the
workmen
are
paid
by
the
day

by
the
month

or
by
the


piece

according
to
the
special
work
which
they
do

but
in
all
cases



and
this

i
believe

has
been
the
rule
here
from
the
beginning

the


workman
is
interested
in
his
work
by
one
premium
on
the
amount

and
by


another
on
the
quality
of
the
work
done

furthermore

and
this
also


dates
from
the
beginning

the
company
look
after
the
primary
education


of
the
children
of
the
workmen

at
st

gobain

at
chauny

at
cirey

at


montlucon

and
i
believe

also

at
waldhof

it
maintains
schools
for


both
sexes
at
its
own
expense

together
with
asylums
and
training


schools
for
the
children

in
these
there
are
now
more
than




children

when
the
company
owns
no
such
school
it
pays
a
subvention
to


the
nearest
school
for
the
benefit
of
the
children
of
its
workmen






here
at
st

gobain
the
company
owns
a
number
of
houses

each
house


having
a
garden
and
dependencies

which
it
lets
to
the
workmen
at
an


average
rental
of
eight
francs
a
month

i
saw
not
long
ago

at
one
of


the
stations
on
a
line
newly
opened
by
the
great
eastern
railway
company


of
england

very
neat
and
even
handsome
cottages
well
built
of
brick
and


thoroughly
comfortable

which
are
leased
to
servants
of
the
company
at


s


d


a
week

or
ten
shillings
a
month

the
houses
i
saw
at


st

gobain
let
at
less
than
seven
shillings
a
month

were
quite
as
large


as
those
of
the
great
eastern
company

and
the
gardens
were
much
larger






i
gathered
from
the
remarks
made
to
me
at
st

gobain
by
people
who


seemed
to
be
both
well
informed
and
well
disposed

that
of
late
years


the
liberality
of
the
company
in
regard
to
these
houses
has

in
not
a


few
cases

worked
mischief
rather
than
good

they
are
not
confined
to


st

gobain

and
the
company
owns
and
leases
no
fewer
than


of


them

a
good
many
allotments
of
land
around
the
factories
are
also
made


at
nominal
rates
to
the
workmen

who
cultivate
them
assiduously

the


glass
founders
are
particularly
favoured
in
making
these
leases
and


allotments

besides
these
houses
meant
for
families

the
company


provides
lodgings
near
the
factories
for
unmarried
workmen

or
for


workmen
whose
homes
are
at
a
considerable
distance
from
their
work






within
the
buildings
of
the
manufactory
itself
at
st

gobain

m



henrivaux
showed
me
some
such
lodgings

as
well
as
several
bath
rooms


which
the
workmen
are
allowed
to
use
on
the
payment
of
a
very
slight


fee

it
is
his
experience
that
the
workmen
prefer
to
consider
the
bath


as
a
luxury

and
to
pay
for
it






all
the
relations
between
the
company
and
its
workmen

indeed

seem
to


me
to
be
governed
by
a
sensible
avoidance
on
the
part
of
the
company
of


everything
like
fussy
paternalism

and
to
this

in
some
measure

i
have


no
doubt

must
be
attributed
the
remarkably
smooth
and
easy
working
of


these
relations
through
so
long
a
course
of
years

the
workmen
are


treated

not
like
children

but
like
reasonable
beings

who
may
be


expected
to
avail
themselves
of
advantages
which
are
offered
them
with


an
eye
at
once
to
their
own
interests
and
to
the
interests
of
the


company






the
co
operative
societies
at
st

gobain
and
at
chauny

for
example



were
founded
in


not
by
the
company

but
by
the
employees
of
the


company
under
statutes
carefully
drawn
up
by
m

cochin

and
the
company


simply
undertook
to
assist
them

in
the
first
place
by
leasing
them

at


a
low
rent

the
buildings
necessary
for
the
business

and
in
the
next


place
by
taking
charge
gratuitously
of
their
financial
operations

the


goods
supplied
are
sold
only
to
members
of
the
societies

as
in
the


co
operative
stores
in
england

the
transactions
amount
to
about





francs
a
year

the
goods
are
sold
at
prices
below
those


charged
in
the
local
shops

and
the
members
divide
an
average
annual


profit
of
from
eight
to
ten
per
cent

the
management
is
entirely
in
the


hands
of
the
members






the
company
has
founded
at
st

gobain
a
kind
of
savings
bank
in
which


the
workman
may
make
deposits
of
from
one
franc
to

francs

drawing


interest
at
the
rate
of

per
cent

per
annum

until
the
maximum
is


reached

when
the
money
is
either
paid
back
to
the
depositor
or

if
he


prefers

invested
for
him

without
charge
by
the
company

in
the
public


funds
or
in
railway
securities

in
this
way
many
of
the
workmen
are


coming
to
be
small
capitalists

if
they
wish
also
to
become
house
owners


the
company
advances

at
the
lowest
possible
rate
of
interest

the


necessary
funds
for
the
purchase

and
workmen
in
good
standing
with
the


company
find
no
difficulty
in
getting
gratuitous
advances
of
money


repayable
in
small
fixed
amounts

upon
showing
good
reasons
for
the


advance

and
in
all
the
establishments
of
the
company

except
at


montlucon

where
there
is
a
special
fund
to
give
assistance
in
cases
of


accident
or
disease

the
workmen
and
their
families
are
entitled
to


medical
advice
and
medicines
at
the
expense
of
the
company






in
addition
to
all
these
arrangements
for
promoting
a
real
community
of


interests
between
the
company
and
its
employees

there
is
a
pension
fund


out
of
which
retiring
pensions

varying
from
one
fifth
to
one
fourth
of


the
wages
earned
by
the
pensioner

are
granted
to
employees
who
have


served
the
company
for
a
certain
number
of
years

or
who
find
themselves


disabled
from
further
service
by
age
or
by
disease

a
certain


proportion

determinable
by
the
circumstances
of
each
case

of
these


pensions
is
settled
upon
the
widows
and
young
children
of
the


pensioners

and
in
order
to
encourage
habits
of
thrift
and
forecast


among
the
workmen

the
company
undertakes
to
manage
without
charge
the


investment
of
a
certain
proportion
of
his
wages
by
any
workman
in
the



pension
fund

of
the
national
government






the
total
outlay
of
the
company
upon
these
various
methods
of
promoting


a
community
of
interests
between
itself
and
its
employees
amounted
in



to


francs

thus
divided












































francs




pensions































medical
service
























schools
and
religious
services










recreations





























gifts
and
assistance





















the
outlay
upon

recreation

is
made
in
the
form
of
subventions
and


prizes
granted
to
associations
of
the
workmen

such
as
shooting
and


gymnastic
clubs
and
musical
societies

the
manufactory

for
example



boasts
a
philharmonic
society
of
its
own

and
there
is
a
choral
society


of
st

gobain

both
of
these
have
scored
successes
in
various
public


exhibitions

there
is
a
rifle
club

founded
in


and
reconstituted


in


with
an
eye
to
the
possible
military
necessities
of
the


country






the
relations
between
the
company
and
its
employees
under
this
system



the
germs
of
which
were
planted
here
two
centuries
ago

have
assumed


such
a
character
that
the
workmen
habitually
speak
not
of
the


manufactory
but
of
the

maison


they
are
and
feel
themselves
to
be


members
of
a
great
economic
family

of


persons
now
actively


employed
in
st

gobain

chauny

and
cirey



or


per

have


been
employed
for
more
than
thirty
years



or


per
cent


for


more
than
twenty
and
less
than
thirty
years



or


per
cent


for


more
than
ten
and
less
than
twenty
years

and
only



or


per


cent


for
less
than
ten
years






it
would
be
instructive
to
compare
this
record
with
the
records
of
the


most
important
industrial
establishments
in
england
and
america
during


the
past
thirty
years

and
i
should
be
glad
to
see
this
done
by
some
of


the
people
who
talk
so
glibly
in
england
and
america
of
the
inherent


fickleness
and
instability
of
the
french
character

as
offering
an


adequate
explanation
of
the
political
catastrophes
which
have
so
often


recurred
in
france
during
the
past
century






one
of
the
most
curious
features
of
the
establishment
at
st

gobain
is
a


subterranean
lake

the
fine
forests
around
st

gobain
and
la


fere

forests
of
oak

beech

elm

ash

birch

maple

yoke
elm

aspen



wild
cherry

linden

elder

and
willow

flourish
upon
a
tertiary


formation

the
surface
of
clay
keeps
the
soil
marshy
and
damp

but
this


checks
the
infiltration
of
the
rainwater
and
therefore
favours
the


growth
of
the
trees

in
the
calcareous
rock
the
early
inhabitants


hollowed
out
for
themselves
caverns

in
which
they
took
refuge
from


their
enemies
and
from
the
beasts
of
the
forest

and
these
caverns



called
by
the
people

creuttes


an
obvious
corruption
of
the
name
of



crypts


given
them
by
the
roman
conquerors
of
gaul

just
as
the
early


french
trappers
gave
the
name
of

caches

to
the
indian
hiding
places
of


the
far
west

are
to
be
found
all
about
soissons
and
laon

the
more


modern
lords
of
st

gobain

its
monks
and
its
barons

dug
out
of
the


calcareous
rock
the
stones
which
they
used
to
build
their
chateaux
and


their
churches

and
they
created
great

creuttes

beneath
st

gobain

it


seems
to
have
occurred
to
m

deslandes

during
his
long
and
skilful


supervision
of
the
works
here

that
these
caverns
might
be
put
to
the


very
practical
use
of
securing
an
adequate
water
supply

the
idea
has


been
thoroughly
carried
out

and
the
subterranean
reservoir
of


st

gobain
is
much
more
impressive
as
a
spectacle
than
the
crypts
of
the


cisterns
at
constantinople

it
is
kept
filled
to
an
average
depth
of
one


metre
by
the
infiltration
of
the
surface
waters
and
by
the
overflow
of
a


pond

la
marette

on
the
plateau
of
st

gobain

and
it
covers
an
area
of


some


square
metres






after
two
or
three
hours
spent
in
visiting
the
various
departments
of


the
glassworks
overhead

m

henrivaux
led
me
through
winding
passages



which
reminded
me
of
the
dismal
vomitories
at
baiae

down
into
this


strange
underworld

walls
and
pillars

partly
of
the
natural
rock

left


in
the
working
of
the
quarries

partly
of
masonry
built
up
to
strengthen


the
reservoir

give
this
weird
water

when
you
reach
it

the
aspect


rather
of
a
stream
than
of
a
lake

a
workman

who
had
preceded
and


guided
us
with
a
swinging
lantern

put
out
a
long
boathook

and
drew


slowly
around
to
the
landing
place
a
long

shallow
boat

into
which
he


invited
us
to
step

m

henrivaux
had
kindly
sent
orders
in
the
morning


to
have
the
reservoir
illuminated
with
venetian
and
chinese
lanterns
of


various
colours

these
had
been
hung
from
hooks
in
the
rocks
and
pillars


with
infinite
good
taste
at
long
intervals

so
as
to
illuminate
not
too


brilliantly
the
mystical
darkness
of
the
scene

looking
upon
the
vague



indefinite
vista

as
it
glimmered
away
into
an
indefinable
distance

one


seemed
really
to
stand







where
alp

the
sacred
river

ran




through
caverns
measureless
by
man







down
to
a
shoreless
sea






seating
ourselves
carefully
in
the
boat

our
silent
boatman

like
a


spectral
gondolier

rowed
us
silently
along
the
labyrinthine
canals
of


this
dim
and
ghostly
venice

vathek
beckford
would
have
made
them


waterways

the
lively
little
city
of
chauny

standing
in
the
heart
of
the
rich
and


lovely
valley
of
the
oise

the

golden
vale

of
this
part
of
france

has


a
history
of
its
own
of
which
i
shall
presently
have
something
to
say



and
which
throws
some
interesting
light
upon
the
general
history
of


france






but
chauny
owes
its
actual
prosperity
mainly
to
its
connection
with
the


company
of
st

gobain

from
a
very
early
period
in
the
annals
of
the


company

the
plate
glass
made
at
st

gobain
was
sent
across
the
country


to
chauny

and
thence
by
water
to
paris

where
it
was
polished
and



tinned

at
the
company
s
works
in
the
rue
de
reuilly






when
the
first
machines
were
invented
for
saving
much
of
the
manual


labour
spent
upon
these
processes

it
occurred
to
the
managers
of
the


company
that
these
machines
might
be
advantageously
worked
with
the


water
power
of
the
oise
at
chauny

this
was
in
the
beginning
of
the


present
century

about
the
same
time

thanks
to
the
foreign
wars


provoked
by
the
girondists
to
promote
the
revolution

it
became
very


difficult
to
obtain
the
supplies
of
natural
soda
necessary
for
the


manufacture
of
plate
glass

these
supplies
having
been
drawn

down
to


that
time

almost
exclusively
from
alicante
in
spain

and
the
chemist


leblanc
hit
upon
a
process
for
extracting
soda
on
a
great
scale
from


sea
salt

of
this
invention
the
managers
of
st

gobain
promptly
availed


themselves

and

after
a
brief
and
unsatisfactory
experiment
at
a
place


called
charlesfontaine

they
established
at
chauny
some
soda
works



which
have
since
been
developed
into
the
most
extensive
chemical
works


in
france






taken
in
conjunction
with
the
glassworks
also
now
established
here



these
works
extend
over
an
area
of
some
thirty
hectares

fourteen
of


which
are
occupied
by
buildings

numerous
canals
fed
from
the
oise


traverse
this
immense
area

some
of
them
supplying
water
power

others


serving
as
waterways

the
place

in
short

is
an
industrial
amsterdam
or


rotterdam
in
miniature

lying
between
the
river
oise

the
canal
de


st

quentin

and
the
canal
de
st

lazare

the
cite
ouvriere

built
for


the
workmen
by
the
company

lies
beyond
the
canal
de
st

lazare
and
on


the
road
from
chateau
thierry
in
champagne

the
birthplace
of
la


fontaine

to
bethune
in
artois






the
streets
and
areas
within
the
works
are
most
appropriately
baptized


by
the
names
of
the
eminent
men
of
science
to
whom
the
company
is


indebted
for
great
services
either
directly
or
indirectly

the

lavoisier

the
rue
hely
d

besides
the
dwellings
put
up
for
the
benefit
of
the
workmen
at
chauny



the
company
has
built
here
a
chapel

established
a
free
dispensary

and


organised
excellent
schools
for
the
children
of
both
sexes

under
the


supervision
of
the
devoted
sisters

who
have
not
yet
been

converted



out
of
chauny







what
is
the
feeling
of
the
people
here
on
this
question
of
clerical


teaching


i
asked
an
acquaintance
of
mine

who
formerly
filled
an


important
post
in
the
local
administration
of
this
region

and
who
now


devotes
himself
to
his
flowers
and
his
library
in
a
charming
old
house


of
the
eighteenth
century

the
high
walled
courtyard
of
which
is


tapestried
with
luxuriant
vines
and
creepers







all
the
sensible
people
in
chauny


he
said


and
there
are
many


sensible
people
in
chauny

though
in
the
old
times
our
neighbours
used


to
speak
of
us
as

the
monkies
of
chauny


are
quite
disgusted
with
all


this
newfangled
nonsense

and
with
these
incessant
attacks
on
the


clergy

the
troublesome
element
here
in
chauny
is
not
to
be
found
among


the
workmen

it
is
to
be
found
among
the
people
who
do
not
work

of


course

everybody
knows
that
it
is
the
great
chemical
and
glass
works


here
which
make
chauny
prosperous

but
for
st

gobain
we
should
be
where


we
were
a
hundred
years
ago

and
so
there
is
a
tendency
all
through
the


department
to
come
to
chauny

in
hopes
of
finding
work
under
the


company

of
course

in
nine
cases
out
of
ten

those
who
seek
it
thus
do


not
get
it

for
it
is
the
rule
of
the
company
always
to
give
the


preference
to
people
from
chauny

or
the
immediate
neighbourhood







of
course
the
unsuccessful

immigrants

linger
about
the
place

and
as


they
don
t
find
work
they
go
lounging
about
the
town

and
take
to
drink


too
often
and

in
short

soon
become
the
raw
material
of
which
in
these


days
the
freemasons
are
making
what
they
call

republicans


you
have
it


all


he
added


in
the
letter
which
m

allain
targe
has
just
written



refusing
to
be
a
candidate
this
year
for
the
chambers







i
remembered
very
well
the
energy
shown
by
m

allain
targe

as
a


republican
minister
of
the
interior

at
the
time
of
the
elections
of


october




he
then
issued
an
official
circular
instructing
all


the
public
functionaries
that

while
they
were
to
be
absolutely



neutral

as
between
republican
candidates
of
different
colours

they


must
exert
themselves
to
the
utmost
as
against
all

reactionary



candidates

i
was
much
interested

therefore

to
learn
the
present


opinion
of
m

allain
targe
as
to
the
outlook
of
the
republic
under
his


successor

m

constans

in


it
was
very
instructive
to
find
that
m



allain
targe
now
declines
to
be
a
republican
candidate
because

to
use


his
own
words

though
the
high
court
of
justice
may

deliver
the


republic
from
general
boulanger
and
his
confederates

it
is
beyond
the


power
of
the
high
court
of
justice
to
bring
france
back

let
us
not
say


to
the
heroic
age

but
to
the
age
of
good
faith

of
disinterestedness



of
common
sense

and
of
that
prudent

sincere

and
loyal
policy

thanks


to
which

during
long
years

france
passed
safely
through
so
many


serious
trials








the
new
generations
of
electors


says
m

allain
targe
in
this


remarkable
letter


exact
of
their
representatives
conditions
to
which
i


will
not
submit

i
will
not
undertake
to
make
the
promises
which
it
is


now
the
fashion
of
candidates
to
lavish

and
which
i
cannot
regard
as


serious


these

new
generations
of
electors

are
the

new
social


strata

about
which
gambetta
used
to
declaim
so
confidently
only
a
few


years
ago

and
i
quite
agreed
with
my
philosophic
friend
near
chauny
in


thinking
that
no
slight
significance
must
attach
to
such
a
verdict
upon


them

pronounced
in

by
an

advanced
republican

like
m



allain
targe

who
only
four
years
ago

in


was
the
most
active


minister
of
a
government
called
into
existence
to
carry
out
the
ideas
of


gambetta

and
to
found
a
stable
republic
upon
these

new
social
strata







put
into
plain
english

this
letter
of
m

allain
targe

who
had
more


than
any
of
his
colleagues
to
do
directly
and
in
the
way
of
business


both
with
the
electors
and
with
the
elected
of
france
four
years
ago



and
who
now
declines
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
them
all

simply


means
that
the
electors
sell
their
votes
to
the
highest
bidder

and
that


the
man
who
will
make
the
most
unscrupulous
bid
is
likeliest
to
get
the


votes

it
is
hard
to
see
much
difference
between
such
a
verdict
and
the


outspoken
declaration
of
m

paul
de
cassagnac
that
law

order

property



and
liberty
in
france
are
threatened
to
day

not
by
a

democracy


but


by
a

voyoucratie

or

blackguardocracy







the

anti
clerical

agitation
here

as
elsewhere
in
france

i
am


assured

is
plainly
under
the
control
of
the

freemasons


not
that
the



freemasons

are
avowedly
very
numerous
here

but
they
are
influential


because
they
act
together

in
silence

and
on
lines
common
to
the


agitation
all
over
france


three
or
four
energetic
members
of
the


order


said
one
very
intelligent
man
to
me
here
at
chauny


can
easily


manage
the
whole
official
machinery
of
a
large
political
district

to


understand
their
methods
and
their
organisation
you
must
go
back
to
the


worship
of
baphomet
in
the
middle
ages

in
some
of
their
lodges
they


reproduce
with
a
goat
one
at
least
of
the
abominations
which
von
hammer


tells
us
were
charged
upon
the
knights
templars
as
baphometic

they
are


a
sect

a
persecuting
sect

and
a
sect
bent
on
absolutely
destroying
the


christian
religion

to
this
end
they
parody
the
christian
symbols
and


the
christian
scheme
of
charity
and
of
good
works

they
do
not

most
of


them

hold
office

it
being
much
more
to
the
purpose
for
them
to
awe
the


officials

and
that
is
their
favourite
way
of
working

there
are



however

exceptions
to
this

if
you
go
to
marmande
in
the
south
you
will


find
a
sub
prefect
there
who
is
a
most
energetic
and
mischievous



freemason


in
the
aisne
the
prefect
is
a
freemason

and
here
all
the


public
functionaries
go
in
fear
of
the
order

they
own
the
newspaper



control
profitable
contracts
of
all
sorts

and
can
make
or
mar
the


career
of
public
servants

through
their
occult
relations
with
people
at


headquarters
in
paris







i
suggested
that
in
england
and
germany
and
the
united
states
the



freemasons

are
not
only
regarded
as
friends
of
order
and
of
law

but


number
among
their
dignitaries
men
of
the
highest
official
and
personal


rank







that
is
quite
true

no
doubt


he
said


but
this
order
in
france
has



i
believe

no
official
relations
now
with
the
order
in
either
of
these


countries

its
affiliations
are
with
the

freemasons

of
italy

of


belgium

and
of
spain

so
far
as
it
has
any
affiliations

there
have


been

freemasons


as
you
must
know

among
the
radical
leaders
in


belgium
who
have
not
hesitated

while
holding
high
public
positions

to


denounce
christianity
in
open
meetings
as
a

corpse
blocking
the
way
of


modern
progress


and
what
the
freemasonry
of
italy
and
of
spain
is
i
am


sure
you
must
know







i
told
him
that
in
spanish
america
and
in
brazil
i
had
met
priests
who


were
members
of
the
order

and
i
particularly
cited
the
case
of
an


ecclesiastic
of
considerable
importance

who
in
costa
rica

some
ten
or


twelve
years
ago

was
at
the
head
of
the
order
of
freemasons
in
that


country







that
may
be


he
replied


but
officers
of
our
expedition
into
mexico


under
maximilian
have
told
me
that
the
freemasons
in
mexico
were
active


allies
of
the
liberals
and
of
juarez
in
their
war
against
the
church







this
i
could
not
contradict

for
while
i
never
heard
that
president


juarez
was
himself
a

freemason


i
know

from
my
conversations
with
him


after
the
fall
of
the
empire

in


that

though
educated
by
the


priests
in
oajaca

as
robespierre
was
by
the
priests
in
arras

he
was
an


unbeliever
of
the
type
of
the
advanced
encyclopaedists
of
the
last


century

and
though
not
such
a
fanatic
as
condorcet

strongly
disposed



not
only
to
deprive
the
mexican
clergy
of
their

fueros

under
the
old


spanish
system

but
to
make
an
end
of
catholicism
in
mexico
if
possible



nor
was
he
much
more
friendly
to
the
protestants

who
were
then
trying



under
bishop
riley

to
found
a
protestant
propaganda
in
mexico







in
france

at
all
events
under
the
third
republic


he
went
on


the



freemasons

are
the
implacable
enemies
of
religion

it
was
in
full


accord
with
them

and
as
a
battle
cry
in
their
interest

that
gambetta


uttered
his
famous
declaration
that

clericalism
is
the
enemy


and
if


the

freemasons

of
any
other
country
recognise
and
in
any
fashion


affiliate
with
the
grand
orient
of
france

they
ought
to
understand
what


they
are
doing

and
to
what
objects
they
are
lending
themselves



consciously
or
unconsciously

you
tell
me
that
general
washington
was
a


freemason

yes

no
doubt

but
the
freemasonry
which
he
accepted
was
no


more
like
the
modern

freemasonry

of
france
than
this
third
republic
of


ours
is
like
the
republic
of
which
he
was
the
founder







the
processes
carried
on
in
the
great
chemical
works
at
chauny
are
in


their
way
as
interesting
as
the
processes
carried
on
at
st

gobain
or
in


the
glassworks
here

but
i
cannot
say
they
are
as
pleasant

or
even
as


picturesque

commercially
speaking

the
output
of
the
chemical
works
of


this
great
company
is
at
least
as
important
now
as
the
output
of
its


glassworks

the
chemical
works
grew
up
out
of
the
necessities
of
the


glassworks

when
the
company
was
led

at
the
beginning
of
this
century



by
the
pressure
of
the
war
epoch

to
adopt
in
its
glassworks
the
use
of


the
artificial
soda
made
by
leblanc

the
director
soon
found
it


advisable
to
have
the
artificial
soda
manufactured
by
the
company


itself

this
led
to
the
establishment
of
the
chemical
works
at
chauny



and
down
to

the
company
itself
was
the
chief
consumer
of
these


chemical
products

the
exposition
of
that
year
widened
the
horizon

by


making
france
acquainted
with
the
agricultural
importance
of
the
english


fabrication
of

superphosphates

as
fertilisers

at
the
exposition
of



the
company
of
st

gobain
exhibited

and
received
a
gold
medal

for


superphosphates

which
it
was
then
turning
out
at
the
rate
of




tons
a
year
from
three
establishments

one
at
chauny

one
at
l
oseraie



and
one
at
montlucon

as
the
company
was
then
turning
out
a
great


production
of
sulphuric
acid

and
owned
the
only
important
mine
of


pyrites
in
france

it
went
on
with
increasing
energy

and
now

in




shows
an
output
of


tons
of
superphosphates

from
no
fewer
than


six
establishments

chauny

aubervilliers

marennes

saint
fons
near


lyon

l
oseraie

and
montlucon

besides
these
it
possesses
salt
works
at


art
sur
meurthe

its
iron
pyrites
works
at
sain
bel

and
some
important


deposits
of
phosphates
at
beauval

these
give
employment
to
no
fewer


than


workmen

independently
of
those
employed
by
the
company
at


its
various
glassworks
in
the
glass
manufacture

at
chauny
alone
the


chemical
works
employ


of
these
workmen

for
these

as
for
its


glassworkers

the
company
has
established
a
system
of
savings


institutions
and
of
pensions

medical
advice
and
medicines
are
given


gratuitously
to
the
workmen
and
their
families

the
co
operative


association
founded
by
m

cochin
at
st

gobain
has
not

i
believe

been


extended
to
the
chemical
works

but
the
company
maintains


establishments
which
supply
the
chief
wants
of
the
workpeople
at
cost


price

and
the
dwellings
provided
for
them

either
gratuitously
or
at


very
low
rents

now
number
more
than
seven
hundred

independently
of
the


dormitories
for
unmarried
workmen

retiring
pensions

varying
from


one
fifth
to
one
fourth
of
the
wages
of
the
workmen

are
granted
to
all


after
a
certain
number
of
years
of
service

and
to
workmen
disabled
by


disease
or
by
accidents






at
the
pyrites
mine
of
sain
bel

in
the
south

near
tarare

where
more


than

workmen
are
employed


as
miners
and
the
rest
in
the
works


above
named

the
former
earning
on
an
average


fr


c


and
the


latter
on
an
average


fr


c

a
year

a
system
exists
under
which


any
workman
who
chooses
to
put
aside
his
savings
in
a

caisse
de
la


vieillesse

receives
from
the
company

when
he
has
completed
twenty
five


years
of
service

or
has
attained
the
age
of
fifty
five
years

an
annual


pension
more
than
equal
to
the
amount
at
that
time
of
his
savings
in
the



caisse







as
i
have
said

the
manufacture
of
chemical
products
is
not
so
pleasant


or
so
picturesque
in
itself
as
the
manufacture
of
plate
glass
and


mirrors

within
the
last
decade
the
output
of
sulphuric
acid
alone
from


the
company
s
works
has
more
than
doubled

and
now
amounts
to
more
than




tons
a
year

the
gases
disengaged
in
the
manufacture
of
chemical


fertilisers

such
as
carbonic
acid

sulphuretted
hydrogen

fluorine
of


silicium

and
so
on

it
was
found
at
chauny

destroyed
entirely
in
a


very
short
time
the
polish
of
the
glass
in
the
window
panes
of
the


houses
opposite
to
the
works

and
certainly
did
not
improve
either
the


respiratory
organs
or
the
general
health
of
the
workmen

the
company


therefore
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
and
of
money
in
working
out
a
system


for
the
complete
condensation
of
these
gases

i
am
told
that
it
has


proved
completely
successful

and
is
now
established
in
all
the


chemical
works
of
the
company

to
the
great
advantage
not
only
of
the


workmen

but
of
the
company
also






although
chauny
is
really
a
very
ancient
city

dating
back
at
least
to


the
age
of
charlemagne

when
the
monks
of
cuissy
and
st

eloi
fontaine



with
the
keen
eye
of
those
early
agriculturists
for
a
good
thing



reclaimed
its

turned
them
into

it
has
almost
nothing
to
show
to
day
in
the
way
of
antique


architecture

of
the

seven
comforts
of
life


the
vine
has
vanished


also

but
all
the
others
flourish
abundantly

and
the
people
of
chauny


have
little
to
complain
of
on
the
score
of
the
natural
resources
of


their
region

during
the
wars

though

of
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth


centuries

the
place
was
so
often
taken
and
retaken
that
its
buildings


were
pretty
well
battered
to
pieces

the
english
of
harry
the
fifth


stormed
it
in


and
england
held
it
for
a
quarter
of
a
century



during
which
period
an
incident
occurred
much
more
creditable
to
the


burghers
of
chauny
than
is
the
taking
of
the
bastille
in

to
the


citizens
of
paris

monstrelet
tells
the
story
in
a
quaint
and
vigorous


fashion

chauny
at
that
time
was
part
of
the
appanage
of
the
duc


d
orleans

then
a
prisoner
in
england

and
it
was
held
for
the


conquerors
by
a
french

nobleman


messire
collard
de
mailly


who
had


accepted
the
office
of
bailli
of
vermandois
from
king
henry
of
england



the
burghers
of
chauny

who
had
lived
for
two
centuries
in
the
enjoyment


of
the
rights
and
privileges
granted
them
in
a
royal
charter
by
philip


augustus

did
not
like
this
state
of
things
at
all

so
they
made
up


their
minds
to
demolish
the
castle

lest

messire
collard
de
mailly



should
fill
it
with
english
soldiers
and
make
himself
quite
unendurable






it
was
a
rather
hardy
enterprise

and
the
burghers
went
about
it
with


great
coolness
and
good
sense

theirs
was
a
real
rising
of
the
citizens


of
a
town
to
abate
a
nuisance
which
threatened
their
liberties

and
not



like
the
attack
on
the
bastille

a
blow
struck
at
law

order

and
the


constituted
authorities
of
a
great
kingdom
by
a
subsidised
mob

and


their
leaders
were
the
most
respectable
men
of
chauny

not
a
crew
of


thieves
and
murderers
like
the
infamous
maillard

that

hero
of
the


bastille


against
whom
his
own
employers
and
allies
were
eventually


forced
to
proceed
as
the
chief
of
a
gang
of
ruffians

and
who

not


content
with
assassinating
political
prisoners
and
stealing
their


property
in
paris

roamed
all
over
the
departments
of
the
seine
and
the


seine
et
oise

torturing
farmers
to
make
them
give
up
their
money

and


maddening
the
countryside
with
outrages
not
to
be
described






jean
and
mathieu
de
longueval

pierre
piat



and
other

notable


persons

of
chauny

bound
themselves
together
by
an
oath

in


to



take
the
fortress
of
the
city
and
demolish
it


they
chose
an
occasion


when
the
bailli

collard
de
mailly

and
his
brother

ferry
de
mailly



with
some
of
their
men

went
riding
out
of
the
fortress

to
take
their


pleasure
in
the
town














that

pierre
piat

was
a
man
of
character
as
well
as
of






substance
appears
from
the
fact
that
he
was
charged
with
seeing
that






his
wife

the
cousin
of
a
rich
and
charitable
lady
of
chauny

marie






martine
de
feure

who
died
in


should
each
year
receive

under






the
will
of
this
good
dame


a
large
piece
of
linen
cloth
whereof
to






make
shrouds
for
the
poor
who
might
die
in
the
hospital
of
the






hotel
dieu
at
chauny


obviously
there
was
much
better
stuff
for
the






making
of
a
true
republic
among
these
good
burghers
of
chauny
in
the






fifteenth
century
than
was
to
be





found
among
the
shouting
mobs
of
the
palais
royal
in
the
eighteenth






with
a
few
courageous

companion
adventurers


previously
posted
in


hiding
near
the
castle

these
determined
burghers
suddenly
sallied



forth
from
the
place
where
they
were
watching
the
castle
gates

and

no


one
paying
any
heed
to
them

entered
the
castle
courtyard

drew
up
the


bridge
after
them

and
took
possession








news
of
this
going
after
the
two
brothers

they
were
sore
displeased



but
they
could
do
nothing


says
the
chronicler


for
the
citizens
who


were
in
the
plot
straightway
fell
to
sounding
the
tocsin

and
gathering


about
the
castle
in
great
numbers

with
arms
and
with
sticks

were
soon


admitted
into
it







the
castle
being
thus
secured


sundry
notables
of
the
city
went
to
meet


the
two
knights

and
assured
them
that
no
harm
should
come
to
them
or


theirs

for
that
what
had
been
done
was
done
only
for
the
peace
and


prosperity
of
the
city


quite
different
this
from
the
cowardly
murder


of
the
governor
of
the
bastille

struck
down
after
his
surrender
by
some


of
maillard
s
confederates

while
that
scoundrel
himself
still
had
his


hand
upon
the
unfortunate
de
launay
s
collar






the

messires
de
mailly

made
the
best
of
a
bad
business

and

with
all


their
friends
and
followers

withdrew
into
an
hotel
in
the
town

there


all
their
property
was
brought
from
the
castle
and
delivered
to
them



which

having
been
done

the
good
people
of
chauny

with
one
accord
fell


to
work
to
slight
and
demolish
the
said
fortress

and
this
with
such


good
will
that
in
a
few
days

time
it
was
wholly
razed
and
destroyed


from
top
to
bottom







the
bailli
and
his
brother
soon
departed
out
of
the
place

and

messires


hector
de
flavy
and
waleran
de
moreul


who
were
sent
to
govern
it
by


the
comte
de
luxembourg


found
the
citizens
much
more
stiff
and


disobedient
than
they
had
ever
been
before
the
desolation
of
the


aforesaid
castle







after
joan
of
arc
had
driven
the
english
out
of
the
realm

charles
vii



had
the
good
sense
to
pardon
the
citizens
of
chauny
for
destroying
the


castle

and
it
was
never
rebuilt

the
spanish
occupied
chauny
after


their
victory
of
st

quentin
in


five
years
afterwards
conde
and


his
huguenots
took
the
place

and
did
so
much
proselytising
there
that


in

chauny
was
one
of
the
first
towns
in
france
to
recognise
henry


of
navarre
as
king
of
france

it
stood
out
for
him
when
laon
and
other


important
towns
in
this
region
had
joined
the
league

and
during
his


long
struggle
with
the
house
of
guise
it
was
a
central
point
about
which


the
hostile
forces
constantly
manoeuvred

henry
himself
came
here


often

and
during
the
siege
of
la
fere

la
belle
gabrielle

kept
him


company
at
chauny

sinceny

and
folembray






in
the
next
century
the
french
and
the
imperialists
fought
all
around


the
place

to
the
great
disgust
of
the
poor
peasants

who
hid
themselves


as
eagerly
in
the
woods
from
the
troops
of
their
own
sovereign
as
from


those
of
his
imperial
enemy

and
in


chauny

after
a
sharp
but


short
siege

surrendered
to
the
spaniards

who

however

agreed

by
the


terms
of
the
capitulation

to

maintain
the
burgesses
in
all
their


goods

rights

privileges

charges

and
offices


the
mayor
of
chauny



claude
le
coulteux

behaved
so
well
in
the
siege

that
louis
xiv



ennobled
him

and
the
cure
of
the
church
of
st

martin

it
is
recorded



fought
at
the
ramparts

and

pointed
the
cannon
with
his
own
hand







this
was
the
last
deed
of
arms
in
the
annals
of
this
little
city

though


the
fortune
of
war
has
twice
put
chauny
under
foreign
rule

in

the


allies

and
in


the
victorious
germans

occupied
it

and
laid
it


under
contribution






that
the
revolution
of

left
the
citizens
of
chauny
much
less


determined
to
do
battle
for
their
rights
than
their
ancestors
were
in


the
days
of
the
english
invaders

may
be
fairly
inferred

i
think

from


the
very
curious
circumstance
that

in


they
actually
made
a
public


subscription
for
the
purpose
of
presenting
a
very
handsome
gold
medal



weighing
two
ounces

to
the
prussian
commander
of
chauny

colonel
von


beulwitz






this
medal
bore
the
inscription

in
french


the
grateful
city
of
chauny


to
m

von
beulwitz

commandant
of
chauny


the
local
authorities
also


asked

and
obtained

for
their
prussian
satrap
and
his
secretary
the


cross
of
the
legion
of
honour






all
this
was
no
doubt
very
creditable
to
the
german
authorities

and
not


discreditable
to
the
good
people
of
chauny

but
it
certainly
seems
to


show
that
at
the
end
of
the
napoleonic
era

the
french
people
in
the


provinces
were
thoroughly
weary
of
the
revolution
and
all
its


consequences

they
welcomed
peace
at
any
price
from
any
quarter

the


testimony
of
all
impartial
contemporary
observers
accords
with
the


deliberate
opinion
given
by
gouverneur
morris
to
alexander
hamilton
in




that
the
french
people
in
general
were
royalists
at
heart

and


utterly
averse
to
the
general
overthrow
of
their
institutions
by
the


legislative
mob
at
paris

or

as
mirabeau
comprehensively
called
them




that
wild
ass
of
the
national
assembly







at
chauny

in


the
inhabitants
held
a
meeting
under
the
presidency


of
the
mayor

at
which
they
declared

with
great
unanimity

that

the


people
of
chauny
had
never

in
fact
and
of
their
own
free
will

adopted


the
impious
and
seditious
principles
introduced
in
france
by
a
factious


minority

and
that
they
regarded
the
death
of
the
most
christian
king



louis
xvi


as
the
most
execrable
of
crimes







chauny
was
a
city
then
of
less
than


inhabitants

but
the


peripatetic

patriots

of

had
contrived
to
do
mischief
enough

even


in
this
small
and
quiet
corner
of
france

to
earn
the
detestation
of
its


people

they
desecrated
its
churches

turning
notre
dame
into
a


saltpetre
factory

stealing
the
church
bells
to
sell
them

pulling
down


the
steeples
and
towers

and
defacing
the
monuments






they
arrested
and
imprisoned
numbers
of
the
best
citizens

broke
up
the


ancient
hospitals

driving
away
the
sisters
of
charity

and
brought


about
the
murder

by
the
revolutionary
tribunals

of
a
celebrated
french


admiral

who
co
operated
in
america
with
rochambeau
to
secure
the


independence
of
the
united
states

the
comte
d
estaing

who
was
well


known
and
very
popular
in
chauny






when
the
tribunal

after
its
fashion

called
upon
the
fearless
sailor


for
his
name

he
replied


you
know
my
name
perfectly
well


it
suits


you

perhaps

to
pretend
that
you
do
not

but
when
you
have
cut
off
my


head

as
you
mean
to
do

send
it
to
the
english
fleet

and
they
will


tell
you
my
name







here
at
chauny

as
elsewhere

the
first
concern
of
these
revolutionary



friends
of
the
people


when
they
got
possession
of
the
machinery
of


the
state

was
to
confiscate
the
funds
devoted
by
the
piety
and
the


benevolence
of
past
ages
to
the
service
of
the
people

the
more
closely


one
looks
into
the
social
annals
of
france

the
more
amazing
it
is
that


the
world
should
so
long
have
swallowed
the
monstrous
misrepresentations


current
in
our
century

as
to
the
condition
of
the
french
people
before




and
especially
as
to
the
organisation

under
the

ancien
regime




of
public
charity
and
of
public
education
in
france






chauny
possessed

as
far
back
as
the
beginning
of
the
twelfth
century



a
public
hospital
or
hotel
dieu

and
a
hospital
for
lepers
called
the



maladrerie


who
founded
the
hotel
dieu
is
not
known

for
in
those



ages
of
faith


so
lovingly
described
by
kenelm
digby

it
was
not


thought
so
extraordinary
a
thing
that
a
man
or
a
woman
should
devote
his


or
her
substance
to
benevolent
purposes

as
it
is
fast
coming
to
be
in


our
own
times






the
mayor
and
sworn
magistrates
of
the
city
were
the
official
governors


of
the
hospital

and
the
chaplain
was
taken
from
among
the
monks
of


saint
eloi
fontaine

a
century
and
a
half
afterwards

in


the
abbot


of
saint
eloi
fontaine
received

under
the
wills
of
three
burghers
of


chauny

a
sum
equal
to
about


francs
of
our
time
for
the
service


of
the
hospital
of
the
hotel
dieu

it
is
worth
remembering
that
the


third
french
republic
has
passed
a
law
forbidding
ecclesiastics
to


receive
or
execute
such
benevolent
trusts
as
this






i
have
already
alluded
in
a
note
to
a
subsequent
legacy
made
to
this


institution
in
the
fifteenth
century
by
a
pious
dame
of
chauny

a
few


years
later

in


colart
le
miroirier

a
resident
of
chauny

left
to


the
hotel
dieu
all
his
lands
and
goods
at
chauny

ognes

and
roy






the

religious
wars

wrecked
the
hotel
dieu
in
the
sixteenth
century



but
in

a
devout
woman

marie
dubuisson

took
the
work
of


reconstruction
in
hand

and
the
citizens
followed
it
up

so
that

by
the


end
of
the
seventeenth
century

it
was
well
in
order
once
more

and
it


continued
to
be
administered
for
the
benefit
of
the
poor
of
chauny
till


the

patriots

confiscated
it
in







under
the
empire

in


the
re
established
hospital
was
combined
with


an
orphan
asylum

and
both
were
put
under
the
charge
of
the
sisters
of


charity

one
of
whom

sister
renee
canet

had
the
good
sense
to
found


here
a
little
manufactory
of
hosiery
and
caps

which
holds
its
own

i
am


told

despite
the
not
very
benevolent
combinations
against
it
of
the


local
hosiers

the
old
buildings
of
the
hotel
dieu

however

no
longer


exist

and
the
chief
public
hospital
of
chauny
is
installed
in
a
large


edifice
put
up
under
the
second
empire
in


and
known
as
the



hospice
sainte
eugenie


in
honour
of
the
empress

it
says
something


for
the
common
sense
of
the
local
authorities
that
they
have
not


insisted
on
changing
the
name
of
the
institution






during
the
orgies
of

the
paintpot
was
busy
with
all
the
streets
and


places
of
chauny

the
rue
de
premontre

so
called
because
some
property


there
belonging
to
the
famous
abbey
of
the
praemonstratensians

became


the

cul
de
sac

or

bag
bottom
of
fraternity


the
rue
des
moinets
took


the
name
of
jean
jacques
rousseau

while
the
rue
ganton

the
licensed


abode
of
the
social
evil
of
chauny

received

with
exquisite
tact
and


propriety

the
name
of
the
roman
hero
scaevola

the
monastery
of
the
holy


cross

founded
by
mary
of
cleves

duchesse
d
orleans

about
the
end
of


the
fifteenth
century

was
confiscated

and
made
the
headquarters
of
the


republican
commission

the
street
on
which
it
stood
receiving
the
name


of
the

bag
bottom
of
vigilance


from
the
banner
which
was
borne
upon


public
occasions
through
the
streets
by
this
commission

on
which
was


depicted

the
eye
of
vigilance

a
symbol
of
that
exercised
by
it
over


the
enemies
of
the
republic
and
the
people







another
street
in
chauny

the
rue
des
bons
enfans

preserves
the
memory


of
the
early
foundation
in
the
little
city
of
public
schools
for
the


children
of
the
poor


les
bons
enfans
escholiers







where
now
stands
the
communal
school
of
chauny
stood

i
am
told

a


public
college

founded
here
in
the
earliest
years
of
the
fourteenth


century

the
buildings
of
this
college
were
restored
under
the
regency


and
louis
xv

they
were
confiscated

and
the
establishment
swept
away
by


the
worthy
revolutionists
of


at
the
same
time
that
they
gave
a


public
ball
in
the
church
of
notre
dame
in
honour
of
the
tree
of


liberty

which
the
young
girls
of
the
place
were
expected
to
attend

in


dresses
of
white

symbolic
of
their
innocence

and
adorned
only
with


their
virtues







besides
this
public
college

chauny

before
the
beneficent
epoch
of
the


revolution

possessed
a
public
school
in
each
parish
of
the
town

the


schoolmaster

besides
his
regular
scholars

who
paid
for
their


education

was
expected
to
receive
and
educate
eight
poor
children


nominated
by
the
mayor
and
sworn
magistrates

for
this
he
received



under
louis
xiv


in


forty
setiers
of
wheat
and
fifty
livres
in


money

it
is
interesting

also

to
learn
that
the
principal
of
the


public
college

when
he
happened
to
be
a
layman

received
a
salary



under
louis
xiv

two


citizens

carra

in

got
permission


to
re
open
the
college

which
the

had
closed

it
has
never


recovered
its
former
importance
however

and
chauny
now
possesses
only
a

i

told

and
two

besides


the
establishments
maintained
by

doctor

doctor
of

sorbonne

canon
and
ecolatre
of
the


collegiale
of
st

quentin

was
a
noble
as
well
as
a
priest

he
founded



on
october




a
fund
for
endowing
two
poor
boys
with
the
funds


necessary
to
enable
them

in
his
own
words


to
serve
the
church
as


ecclesiastics

or
the
public
in
civil
functions


this
phraseology
is


worth
noting
by
people
who
are
tempted
to
believe
the
nonsense
current


in
our
day
to
the
effect
that

almost
everything
we
know
as
modern


civilisation
in
connection
with
institutions
of
a
philanthropic
sort
has


taken
shape
within
the
last
hundred
years

and
is
due
to
the
influence


of
the
revolution
of

in
france







nothing
can
be
wider
of
the
truth
than
this

on
the
contrary

the


progress
of
modern
civilisation
in
connection
with
such
institutions
was


distinctly
checked
and
thwarted
for
a
time
in
france
by
the
shock
of


this
revolution

and
in
other
countries
by
the
horror
and
indignation


which
the
follies
and
crimes
of
the
french
revolutionists
excited






the
foundation
of
the
abbe
bouzier
was
expressly
intended
by
him
to


benefit

the
poorest

of
those
who
should
compete
for
its
advantages



regard
being
had
to
their
natural
ability
and
aptitudes
for
study

each


beneficiary
was
to
enjoy
his
scholarship
for
eight
consecutive
years



dating
from
his
entrance
into
the
third
class

if
he
had
got
beyond
the


third
class
when
he
secured
his
nomination
the
difference
was
to
run


against
him

for
example

a
scholar
ready
to
enter
the
class
of
rhetoric


who
received
a
nomination
was
to
hold
his
scholarship
for
six
years


only

if
he
was
ready
to
enter
upon
the
study
of
theology

law
or


medicine

for
three
years
only

after
the
expiration
of
which
another


must
be
appointed
to
enjoy
it

provisions
were
also
made
to
secure
the


good
conduct
of
the
beneficiaries

how
this
excellent
foundation
escaped


the
cupidity
of
the
revolutionists
is
not
clear






from
june



to
march



the

societe
populaire

of
chauny



organised
by
emissaries
from
paris

ruled
the
town
absolutely

the


official
authorities
of
the
city
and
of
the
district
went
in
abject


terror
of
them

for
a
denunciation
sent
to
the
headquarters
in
paris
by


this
society
was
like
a
report
sent
thither
from
an
army
in
the
field
by


one
of
the
legislative
spies
who
accompanied
the
generals
of
the


republic

and
swaggered
about
in
the
camps
wearing
the
mountebank


costumes
which
may
be
studied
with
amusement
and
advantage
in
the
museum


of
the
revolution
established
this
year
in
the
pavillon
de
flore
at


paris

the
members
of
this

societe
populaire

openly
pillaged
the


churches
and
convents

made
domiciliary
visits

sold
certificates
of



civism


and
dictated
the
most
extraordinary
measures
of
confiscation


and
outrage

their
loudest
leader
was
a
certain
pierre
gogois

who
used


to
wind
up
their
meeting
by
singing
songs
of
his
own
composition



addressed
to
the

crowned
brigands
who
were
trying
to
re
establish
the


abominable
monarchy
with
the
help
of
their
anthropophagous
hordes




these
worthies
abolished
the
school
kept
by
the

daughters
of
the


cross


confiscated
their
property

and
set
up
their
own
headquarters
in


the
convent






in
some
way
the
bouzier
fund
escaped
their
clutches

and
it
has
been
so


well
managed
that
in

the
income
was
found
large
enough
to
warrant


the
managers
in
establishing
three
scholarships
instead
of
two






the
good
example
of
the
abbe
has
been
followed
in
our
own
times
by
a


christian
lady

madame
lacroix
of
sinceny

in
memory
of
her
son

a


councillor
general
of
the
aisne

who
was
universally
esteemed
throughout


the
department

and
who
died
at
the
early
age
of
thirty
five

this
lady


founded

a
few
years
ago
in
perpetuity

eight
prizes

to
be
annually


competed
for
by
the
pupils
of
all
the
communal
schools
of
the
canton
of


chauny

and
by
the
pupils
of
the
schools
established
here
by
the
company


of
st

gobain

as
well
as
four
full
scholarships
at
the
school
of
arts


and
industries
in
chalons
sur
marne






the
prizes
are
to
be
competed
for
in
applied
geometry

in
linear
and


ornamental
drawing

as
well
as
in
all
the
obligatory
studies
of
the


schools
concerned

the
competitors
for
the
four
chalons
scholarships


must
be
the
sons
of
workmen

domestic
servants

labourers

or
persons


employed
in
agriculture
or
in
manufactures
within
the
canton
of
chauny



whose
incomes
or
earnings
do
not
amount
to


francs
a
year






in

the
municipal
council
of
chauny
founded
six
purses
of

francs


a
year

each
to
be
competed
for
by
candidates
wishing
to
fit
themselves


to
compete
for
the
lacroix
scholarships

the
successful
candidates
being


left
at
liberty
to
enter
any
one
of
the
free
schools
in
chauny

as


madame
lacroix
has
made
the
curates
of
the
churches
of
notre
dame
and


st

martin

ex
officio

members
of
the
council
of
her
fund

it
is
to
be


presumed
that
the
government
at
paris
will
find
some
way
of
striking


these
clergymen
out
of
the
list

as
it
has
already
struck
all
ministers


of
religion
out
of
the
local
committees
of
supervision
in
educational


matters
throughout
france

for
a
french
republic
is
nothing
if
not


logical






my
likening
of
chauny
to
a
french
rotterdam
or
amsterdam
may
be
excused


when
i
say
that
in
the
middle
of
the
last
century
the
mayor
of
chauny


assured
the
intendant
of
soissons
that
the
municipality
had
to
keep
up


no
fewer
than
twenty
seven
bridges

what
with
the
oise
and
its


affluents

and
the
many
watercourses
created
about
the
place

either


to
drain
the
marsh
lands
or
to
facilitate
navigation

chauny
really
is


an
aquatic
little
capital
like
annecy
in
savoy

naturally
its
citizens


set
a
certain
value
on
their
fishing
rights

and
it
may
edify
those
who


obstinately
insist
on
regarding
the
feudal
ages
as
ages
of
brute
force



to
know
that
so
early
as
in

the
citizens
of
chauny

by
the


lieutenant
of
the
bailliage

messire
regnault
doucet

asserted
and


successfully
maintained
before
the
royal
representatives
their
right
to


fish
in
all
the
waters
round
about
their
town
in
all
lawful
ways
against


the
pretensions
of
no
less
a
personage
than
the
duchesse
d
orleans

in



this
right
was
confirmed
to
them
anew

and
it
was
then
shown
that


at
an
inquest
held
in

the
witnesses
had
testified
that
from
time


whereof
the
memory
of
man
ran
not
to
the
contrary
no
citizen
of
chauny


had
ever
been
molested
in
the
exercise
of
his
right
to
fish
in
the


waters
of
chauny
either
on
behalf
of
the
duc
d
orleans
or
on
behalf
of


the
king

the
local
archives

which
are
singularly
rich
and


well
preserved

are
full
of
instances
like
this

which
show
that
the


general
current
of
life
in
this
corner
of
france

long
before
the


revolution

was
determined
neither
by
the
caprices
of
the
great

nor
by


the
passions
of
the
mob

but
by
systematic
considerations
of
law
and
of


tradition

until
for
the
confusion
of
france

and
more
or
less
of
the


civilised
world

the
natural
evolution
and
development
of
law
and
order


were
suddenly
and
insanely
interrupted
through
the
inconceivable


weakness
of
a
most
amiable
and
useless
king

by
the

wild
asses

of


mirabeau

acting
in

under
the
pressure
of
what
so
friendly
an


eyewitness
of
their
conduct
as
gouverneur
morris
calls
the

abominable



populace
of
paris






so
complete
was
the
civilisation
of
this
region
long
before
the


revolution
of


that
the
mayor

the
magistrates

and
the
citizens
of


chauny

early
in
the
seventeenth
century

succeeded
in
breaking
down
and


ruining
an
italian
gentleman

cesare
de
rusticis

who

thanks
to


concini

had
secured
a
royal
patent
for
canalising
the
oise
from
la
fere


to
chauny

they
got
a
notable
advocate

m

louis
vrevin

to
draw
up
a


protest
against
the
enterprise
in
the
most
florid
and
elaborate
fashion


of
the

plaideurs

of
racine

and
by
dint
of
bombarding
the
king
s


council
with
the
names
of
julius
caesar

pompey

xerxes

sesostris



cleopatra

cicero

tertullian

and
others

got

in


what
we
in


america
now
call
an

injunction


putting
a
stop
to
the
works
begun
by


this
foreigner

who

had
come
into
france
to
fix
the
eye
of
curiosity


upon
the
river
oyse
and
to
disturb
it


and
a
century
later
i
find
an


operation
carried
out
here
for
converting
a
not
very
satisfactory


private
investment
into
cash
at
the
expense
of
the
state
which
really


would
not
discredit
the
most
ingenious
american

railway
king

of
our


own
times

this
also
concerned
a
canal

the
canal
which
unites
the
oise


with
the
somme

this
waterway
became
the
property
in

of
a


celebrated
millionaire
of
that
time

antoine
de
crozat

and
after
his


death
fell

in
the
division
of
his
estates

to
the
share
of
his


granddaughter

the
duchesse
de
choiseul

it
was
not
very
profitable

and


it
represented
a
capital
which
ought
to
have
yielded



livres
a


year

so
a
certain
m

laurent

who
had
built
for
the
duc
de
choiseul
his


magnificent
chateau
de
chanteloup

near
amboise

pulled
down
fifty
years


ago
by
chaptal

the
first
great
producer
of
beetroot
sugar
in
france




undertook
to
get
the
canal
turned
into
money

the
plate
glass
works
of


st

gobain
were
then
under
the
direction
of
m

deslandes

the
clever


nominee
of
mme

geoffrin

m

laurent
tried
to
persuade
m

deslandes
to


employ
picard
coal

which
could
be
brought
by
the
canal

instead
of
wood


in
the
furnaces
at
st

gobain

m

deslandes
made
the
experiment

but


soon
gave
it
up

as
the
coal
smoke
injured
the
plate
glass

he


consented

however

to
take
four
boatloads
of
the
picard
coal
and
use
it


in
the
forges
connected
with
the
works

this
was
enough
for
m

laurent



who
went
to
paris
with
an
invoice
of
the
four
boatloads
of
coal

laid
it


before
the
council
with
an
elaborate
paper
setting
forth
the
value
to


the
canal
of
a
traffic
necessary
to
carry
on
the
manufacture
of
the


famous
plate
glass
at
st

gobain

and
got
the
council
finally
to


purchase
the
duchesse
s
canal
on
his
own
terms

i
really
do
not
see
what


m

laurent
had
to
learn
either
from
the

contrat
social

of
rousseau
or


even
from
the
american
declaration
of
independence

if
he
had
lived
now


he
would
have
been
a
sharp
competitor
with
a
countryman
of
mine

of
whom


i
am
told
in
chauny
that
he
came
here
only
a
few
years
ago

inspected


the
chemical
works

looked
into
the
composition
of
certain
heaps
of


rubbish
thrown
aside
even
by
the
sagacious
managers
of
these
works

and


setting
up
near
one
of
the
canals
a
genuine
wooden
american
shed

so


applied
to
what
he
found
in
this
rubbish
certain
processes
for
the


vulcanisation
of
indiarubber
as
to
produce
at
very
low
cost
certain


articles
for
which
a
great
and
increasing
demand
exists

and
thus


founded
a
considerable
industry
here

he
has
since
turned
his


establishment
over

i
am
told

to
a
company
at
a
great
profit
to


himself

and
gone
back

to
the
rocky
mountains


i
am
sorry
for
this



for
i
should
have
been
glad
to

interview

him

it
would
be
hard
to
find
in
france

or
out
of
france

on
a
pleasant


summer
s
day

a
more
charming
drive
than
the
highway
which
leads
from


chauny

with
its
great
modern
industries
and
its
lively

bustling


people

to
the
little
feudal
town
of
coucy
le
chateau

perched
upon
its


lofty
hill
and
dominated
by
one
of
the
grandest

if
not

indeed

the


grandest

of
feudal
fortress
homes






i
do
not
know
that
gargantua
would
now
find
the
people
of
chauny
as


entertaining
as
rabelais
tells
us
they
were
in
his
time

then
he

amused


himself
much
with
the
boatmen

and
above
all
with
those
of
chauny
in


picardy

wonderful
chatterboxes

and
great
at
bandying
chaff
on
the


subject
of
green
monkeys


there
is
no
lack
of
boatmen
now
at
chauny



though
the
railway
has
taken
away
much
of
their
living

but
the
glory
of


the
green
monkeys

i
fear

has
departed

in
the
days
of
gargantua

the


chaunois
were
as
famous
as
the
savoyards
now
are

for
wandering
over


france
with
trained
monkeys
and
trained
dogs

on
october

in
each
year



on
the
feast
of
st

remy

every
one
of
these
peripatetic
citizens
was


expected
to
appear
in
his
native
town

there
to
join
in
a
procession


which
marched
from
what
is
now
known
as
the
port
royal
to
the
bailliage



bearing
to
the
lieutenant
general
of
the
king
a
traditional
present
in


the
form
of
a
huge
pasty

decorated
with
eggs
and
chestnuts

and


surmounted
by
a
pastry
tower






to
the
confection
of
this
pasty
the
famous
mills
of
chauny

reputed
the


best
in
france

were
bound
to
contribute
five

setiers

of
wheat

and


the
guild
of
the
butchers
a
calf
s
head






before
the
procession
marched
a
learned
dog

trained
to
all
manner
of


tricks
and
devices

and
upon
either
side
of
the
dog
the
town
trumpeters



sounding
their
finest
and
loudest

fanfares







at
the
bailliage
the
lieutenant
general
received
the
procession

seated


in
a
great
chair
of
state
in
the
midst
of
the
hall

with
wide
open


doors

that
all
the
people
crowding
into
the
place
might
see
what
went


on
within

before
this
high
functionary
the
learned
dog
advanced

quite


alone

and
performed
all
his
best
tricks

he
then
gave
way
to
the
bearer


of
the
pasty

this
having
been
gravely
accepted

after
the
manner
of
a


feudal
homage

by
the
lieutenant
general

the
bearer

passing
it
on
to


the
servants
of
the
bailliage

proceeded
himself
to
imitate
as
exactly


and
as
skilfully
as
possible
all
the
performances
of
his
predecessor
the


learned
dog

amid
the
shouting
and
applause
of
the
multitude






this
over

a
great
silence
fell
upon
the
whole
assembly

and
it
then


became
the
duty
of
the
performer

assuming
an
attitude
of
profound
and


deferential
obeisance

to
salute
the
lieutenant
general
after
a
fashion


more
easily
describable
by
rabelais
or
by
m

armand
silvestre
than
by


me

and
which
seems
to
have
been
derived
from
some
of
the
singular
rites


attributed
by
von
hammer
to
the
templars

as
a
part
of
the
ceremonial


observed
by
them
in
their
secret
conclaves






when
all
this
had
been
duly
gone
through
with

the

jongleurs

of
chauny


received
the
royal
permission
to
resume
their
perambulations
of
the


realm
for
another
year

and
the
day
wound
up
with
junketings
and


jollifications
all
over
the
town






the

jongleurs

and
the
learned
dogs
and
the
green
monkeys
have
passed


away

with
the
lieutenant
general
of
the
king

but
i
found
a
certain


homely
shrewdness
and
vivacity
in
the
people
with
whom
i
talked
as
they


went
in
and
out
of
the


pot
d
etain



the
chief
hostelry
of
the
place



and
the
fact
that
this
chief
hostelry
still
keeps
its
good
old
time
name


of
the

tin
pot


and
has
not
changed
itself
into
a

grand
hotel
de


chauny


seemed
to
me
to
argue
a
survival
here
of
common
sense
and
sound


local
feeling

the
host
of
the

tin
pot


a
solid

well
to
do
personage



learned
in
crops
and
horses

gave
me
a
capital
trap

shaded
with
an


awning
such
as
is
worn
on
the
delightful
little
basket
waggons
at
nice


and
monte
carlo

and
a
wide
awake
driver
for
my
trip
to
coucy
and
anizy



on
the
way
to
laon

his
daughter

a
decidedly
good
looking
young
lady



not
wholly
unconscious
of
her
natural
advantages

who
kept
the
guests
of


the
cafe
in
capital
order

seemed
to
have
no
high
opinion
of
the
powers


that
be
in
france

she
took
up
an
english
sovereign
which
i
laid
down
on


the
counter
when
settling
a
bill

and
looked
at
it
with
much
interest




that
weighs
more
than
a
napoleon


she
said


and
who
is
the
young


lady

she
is
pretty

and
it
is
a
good
head







i
explained
that
the
lady
was
young
because
the
coin
was
old

and
that


the
head
was
the
head
of
the
queen
of
great
britain

who
had
reigned


over
that
realm
for
more
than
fifty
years







more
than
fifty
years


exclaimed
the
damsel


is
it
possible

and


still
the
same
queen

ah

they
are
well
behaved
the
english

no
wonder


they
are
rich

they
are
not
such
babies
as
we
are







after
passing
through
the
well
built
and
neatly
kept

cites
ouvrieres



of
the
chauny
branch
of
the
company
of
st

gobain

and
the
little
suburb


of
autreville

the
highway
to
coucy
le
chateau

and
to
the
once
royal


city
of
soissons

runs
through
such
fine
woodlands

alternating
with


parks
and
highly
cultivated
fields

that
one
seems
to
be
traversing
a


great
private
domain

the
trees
are
as
well
grown
as
any
you
see
in


england

the
hedges
are
luxuriant

the
roadway
is
admirably
made
and


perfectly
well
kept

the
comte
de
brigode
has
a
handsome
chateau
here



standing
well
in
a
large
park

and
there
is
a
good
deal
of
hunting
and


shooting
here
in
the
season






near
by

too

is
the
pleasant
chateau
of
lavanture

long
the
home
of
a


branch
established
here
of
the
once
famous
dauphinese
family
of
de


theis

it
was
brought
here
from
the
land
of
bayard
and
of
de
comines
by


a
stalwart
soldier

one
of
the
lansquenet
officers
of
francis
i


but


its
renown
in
picardy
is
of
a
gentler
and
more
humane
type

and
after


giving
a
long
succession
of
kindly
and
learned
men
to
the
public
service


through
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries

it
finally
died
out


with
constance
de
theis

princesse
de
salm

who
was
known
under
the


directory
and
the
empire
in
paris
as
the

muse
of
reason


and
the



boileau
of
women


and
with
her
nephew

the
last
baron
de
theis

one
of


the
most
charming
of
men

and
one
of
the
most
conscientious
and
accurate


of
archaeologists
and
collectors

the
baron
died
in


the

objets


d
art
et
de
haute
curiosite


brought
together
by
him
with
infinite


pains
and
unerring
taste
into
his
chateau
of
lavanture

were
dispersed


under
the
hammer
of
the
auctioneer

and
lavanture
itself
passed
into
the


possession
of
another
race






this
whole
region
of
the
laonnais
and
the
soissonnais
is
full
of


historic
souvenirs

it
may
be
almost
called
the
cradle
of
the
french


monarchy

its
reasonably
well
authenticated
annals
go
back
to
the
roman


domination

its
mediaeval
monasteries
were
among
the
richest

its


mediaeval
monks
among
the
most
learned
and
industrious
and
useful
of


france

draining
the
marsh
lands

reclaiming
the
wastes

clearing
the


forests

its
feudal
barons
were
typical
men
of
their
order

alike
in


their
virtues
and
in
their
vices

the
seigneurs
of
lizy
and
of
mareilly



of
esternay
and
of
roncy

of
mauny
and
trucy

come
and
go
through
the


archives
of
the
towns
and
communes
here

now
defying
the
kings
of
france


and
trampling
on
the
peasants

now
standing
by
the
peasants
and
still


defying
the
kings

quarrelling
with
and
plundering
the
church
to
day



doing
penance
to
morrow

and
endowing
chapels
and
convents

you


continually
come
amid
the
smiling
farms
and
fertile
acres
upon
some


shattered
hold
whose
towers
once
rose
above
the
hamlet
and
the
church






a
region
such
as
this
in
england
would
be
rich

not
in
historic
ruins


and
historic
recollections
alone

but
in
ancient
strongholds
of
feudal


power
converted
gradually

through
the
gradual
progress
of
a
strong
and


steadfast
race

into
stately
modern
homes

it
would
have
its
warwick


castle
and
its
charlecote

its
guy
s
cliff
and
its
stoneleigh

as
well


as
its
kenilworth






but
in
the
great
houses
and
the
chateaux

of
which
there
is
no
lack
in


the
laonnais
and
the
soissonnais

there
is
little
now
that
is
historic



save
their
names
and
their
sites

they
are
standing
witnesses
to
the


essentially
criminal
and
senseless
character
of
the
revolution
of




the

jacqueries

which
arthur
young
found
raging
all
over
france
during


that
year
of
ill
omen
were
not
much
less
brutal
and
they
were
much
more


inexcusable
than
the

jacqueries

of

for
which
the
comte
de
foix


and
the
captal
de
buch
exacted
the
stern
vengeance
chronicled
by


froissart

they
were
the
cause
and
not
the
consequence
of
that


emigration
of
the
landed
classes
which
contributed
so
much
to
the


downfall
of
law
and
order
in
france






they
were
one
of
the
justifying
causes

not
one
of
the
excusable


consequences

of
the
armed
coalitions
of
the
continent
against


revolutionary
france

petion
and
the
other
scoundrels
in
paris
who


stirred
them
up
were
doubtless

political

criminals

to
adopt
a


distinction
without
a
difference
much
in
favour
in
our
times

but
the


peasants
who
took
an
active
part
in
these
crimes
were
simply
brigands


and
assassins

they
murdered
men

they
tortured
women
and
children

they


pillaged
houses

while
the
king
of
france
and
navarre
was
assembling
the


states
general
to
reform
the
abuses
of
the
government

france
was
at


peace
with
all
the
world

it
was
the
fashion
at
versailles
and
in
the


drawing
rooms
of
paris
to
fall
into
spasms
of
sentimental
emotion
over


periwinkles
and
over
peasants

to
rave
about
the
instinctive
nobility
of


human
nature
and
the
inherent
rights
of
man

never
was
any
country
in


the
world
in
less
danger
of
being
trampled
under
foot
by

tyrants
and


oppressors

than
was
france
in


when
of
a
sudden

all
over
the


kingdom

the
peasants

who
were
about
to
be
liberated
and
crowned
with


flowers

rose
like
wolves
upon
the
landholders
who
were
to
liberate
and


to
crown
them

burst
by
night
into
defenceless
chateaux

dragged
tender


women
and
young
children
out
of
their
beds

and
drove
them
out
into
the


world
penniless
and
to
starve

demolished
all
the
valuables
they
could


not
carry
away

wrecked
the
buildings

burned
the
pictures

the
works
of


art

and
the
libraries






the

terror

of

at
paris
was
black
and
vile
enough

but
the
terror


of

in
the
provinces
was
blacker
and
more
vile

arthur
young
met
on


the
highway
seigneurs
flying
from
their
homes
half
naked

with
their


families

in
the
vain
hope
of
finding
shelter
in
the
nearest
town

at


montcuq

in
what
is
now
the
department
of
the
lot

the
peasants
broke


into
the
chateau
of
the
marquise
de
fondani

and
carried
off
all
the


grain

all
the
beds

a
hundred
and
twenty
sheets

forty
two
dozen


towels

fifty
four
tablecloths

two
hundred

forty
chemises

eleven


silk
dresses

twelve
dresses
of
indian
muslin

thirty
two
pairs
of
silk


stockings

five
fine
aubusson
tapestries

the
plundered
mistress
of
the


house
was
driven
out

to
live
on
the
charity
of
her
friends

her
aunt



aged
ninety
four
years

was
thrown
upon
a
dunghill

where
she
died


gazing
on
the
peasants
whom
she
had
cared
for
and
treated
with
kindness


for
years

as
they
divided
among
themselves
her
house
linen

her


furniture

her
plate

her
porcelains

the
very
doors
and
windows
of
her


home

all
this
was
in
the
summer
of


long
before
a
german
trumpet


sounded
to
arms
on
the
french
frontier

and
all
this
went
on
throughout


the
glorious
year

all
over
france

at
mamers

on
the
dive

in


brittany

in
july


while
the
gardes
francaises
were
dishonouring


the
uniform
they
wore
and
disgracing
the
name
of
france
by
joining
in


the
cowardly
attack
of
a
howling
mob
on
the
bastille

and
protecting
the


ruffians
who
butchered
the
unfortunate
de
launay

the
estimable
peasants


of
that
place
seized
two
ladies

madame
de
barneval
and
madame
des


malets

and
beat
their
teeth
to
pieces
with
stones
like
so
many
comanche


savages






the
people
of
the
city
of
le
mans
at
the
same
time
beat
to
death
m

burned
alive
the
aged
comte
de

broke
into
the


chateau

cut
off
the
ears
and
the
noses
of
all
the
persons


they
found
there

and
drove
them
out
with
pitchforks

following
and


striking
them
till
they
died

in
provence
similar
horrors
were
committed


at
the
same
time

under
the
direct
instigation
of
the
local
authorities



called
there
the
consuls






in
august



m

de
barras
was
cut
in
pieces
before
the
eyes
of
his


wife

madame
de

and
her
two
daughters
were
tied
naked
to
trees


and
tormented

madame
de
monteau
and
all
the
inmates
of
her
house
were


tormented
for
eight
hours
and
then
drowned
in
the
lake
in
her
own


grounds

at
castelnau
de
montmirail

near
cahors

the
head
of
one
of
two


brothers

de
ballud

was
cut
off
and
the
blood
left
to
drip
upon
the


face
of
the
surviving
brother

the
comtesse
de
la
mire
was
seized
in
her


own
house
by
the
peasants
and
her
arms
cut
to
pieces

m

was


slain

roasted

and
eaten
before
the
eyes
of
his

the


abbes

and
dupuy
were
beheaded
and
their
heads
carried
about


on
pikes

m

de
bar
was
burned
alive
in
his
chateau

all
these
horrors



and
innumerable
others
not
less
revolting

were
committed
all
over


france
in
cold
blood

before
the
advance
of
the

standard
of
the


tyrants

had
set
m

rouget
de
l
isle
to
composing
the
declamatory


rigmarole
of
the

marseillaise


is
it
possible
to
regard
a
revolution


which
began
in
this
hideous

cowardly

and
burglarious
fashion
with
any


feelings
other
than
those
inspired
by
the
gordon
riots
of

in


london

if
the
truth
in
regard
to
these
things
could
have
been
known
in


america
in


as
it
may
now
be
learned
from
the
unanswerable


testimony
of
authentic
contemporary
documents
in
france

there
can
be


little
doubt
that
washington
would
have
treated
anyone
who
begged
him
to


accept
a
key
of
the
bastille
as
he
would
have
treated
dickens
s
hugh
or


dennis
tendering
to
him
a
key
of
newgate
prison

with
the
compliments


of
lord
george
gordon






from
the
private
conversation
and
correspondence
of
the
few
americans


then
in
europe
who
really
knew
what
was
going
on
in
france

the
most


thoughtful
and
alert
of
our
public
men
gathered
enough
of
the
truth
to


regard
the
first
french
republic
with
loathing
and
contempt

their


general
feeling
on
the
subject
is
expressed
in
an
entry
in
his
diary


made
during
the
month
of
october



long
before

the
terror


by


gouverneur
morris


surely
it
is
not
the
usual
order
of
divine


providence
to
leave
such
abominations
unpunished

paris
is

perhaps

as


wicked
a
spot
as
exists

incest

murder

bestiality

fraud

rapine



oppression

baseness

cruelty

and
yet
this
is
the
city
which
has


stepped
forward
in
the
sacred
cause
of
liberty







this
picture
of
paris
in

is
the
more
impressive
that
it
was
not


drawn
by
a
puritan
or
a
pharisee

gouverneur
morris
was
eminently
what


is
called
a

man
of
the
world


his
diary
abounds
in
proofs
that

to
use


his
own
language

he
was

no
enemy
to
the
tender
passion


indeed

while


the
elections
for
the
states
general
were
going
on

he
appears
to
have


been
almost
as
much
interested
in
finding
out
the
fair
author
of
an


anonymous
billet
doux
as
in
unravelling
the
politics
of
the
day

he
was


not
so
much
scandalised
by
the
immorality
as
appalled
by
the
lawlessness


of
the
french
capital

he
foresaw
the
failure
of
the
revolution
from
the


outset

a
week
before
the
states
general
met
in
april



he
wrote
to


general
washington


one
fatal
principle
pervades
all
ranks

it
is
a


perfect
indifference
to
the
violation
of
all
engagements







he
noted
at
the
same
time
the
fears
of
necker
lest
it
should
be

found


impossible
to
trust
the
troops







of
the
tiers
etat

when
it
had
carried
into
effect
the
grotesque
and


senseless
dictum

of
the
abbe
sieyes

that
the
tiers
etat

having


thitherto
been
nothing
in
france

ought
thenceforth
to
be
everything



morris
expected
only
what
came
of
it
under
its
self
assumed
title
of
a



national
assembly



it
is
impossible


he
wrote
to
robert
morris
in


america


to
imagine
a
more
disorderly
body

they
neither
reason



examine

nor
discuss

they
clap
those
whom
they
approve

and
hiss
those


whom
they
disapprove




i
told
their
president
frankly
that
it
was


impossible
for
such
a
mob
to
govern
the
country

they
have
unhinged


everything

it
is
anarchy
beyond
conception


and
they
will
be
obliged


to
take
back
their
chains








all
this
was
long
before

the
terror


i
repeat

it
was
long
before

the


terror

that
the
hotel
of
the
duc
de
castries
was
stormed
and
pillaged


in
paris
by
a
mob
because
the
son
of
the
duc

having
been
grossly


insulted
by
a
popular
favourite

de
lameth

had
called
lameth
out



allowed
lameth
s
seconds
to
choose
swords
as
the
weapons

and
then


wounded
lameth

this
monstrous
performance
the
assembly
sanctioned







i
think


wrote
morris
very
quietly


it
will
lead
to
consequences
not


now
dreamt
of







in
this
same
year



long
before

the
terror


morris

noting
in
his


diary
a
conversation
with
general
dalrymple

a
kinsman
of
the
rather


celebrated
madame
elliot

observes


he
tells
me
of
certain
horrors


committed
in
arras

but
to
these
things
we
are
familiarised







it
was
this
essentially
criminal
and
anarchical
character
of
the


revolution
of

which
brought
on

the
terror


not

the
terror

which


engendered
the
crime
and
the
anarchy






why
should

horrors

have
been
committed
at
arras
in


the


contemporary
documents
show
that
the
people
in
and
about
arras
were
much


better
off
in

than
they
had
ever
before
been

the
renting
value
of


farms
about
arras
was
nearly
or
quite
thirty
per
cent

higher
in



than
it
had
been
in


and
it
was
nearly
or
quite

per
cent



higher
in

than
in


m

de
calonne
cites
a
farm
which
had


brought
only


livres
in

as
bringing

in




livres



men
paid
these
advanced
prices
not
for
the
ownership
of
the
land

which


before

carried
with
it
certain
social
distinctions
and
advantages



but
for
the
use

the
productive
and
commercial
use

of
the
land

the


horrors
of
which
general
dalrymple
spoke

at
arras
as
elsewhere


throughout
france

here

in
the
laonnais
and
the
soissonnais

in


provence

in
normandy

in
languedoc

were
perpetrated
not
by
a


downtrodden
peasantry

rising
to
shake
off
oppression

nor
yet
in
the


frenzy
of
a
great
popular
rally
to
resist
a
foreign
invader

they
were


an
outburst
of
crime
stimulated

no
doubt

as
we
are
now
enabled

by


fearless
and
conscientious
investigators
of
the
documentary
history
of


france

to
see

by
cabals
of
political
conspirators
at
paris

just
as


the
gordon
riots
at
london
in

were
stimulated
by
anti
catholic


fanatics

but
in
both
cases
the
perpetrators
were
governed
by
the
mere


lust
of
pillage
and
destruction

chateaux
were
broken
into

sacked

and


burned
here
in
the
laonnais
and
the
soissonnais

as
lord
mansfield
s


house
was
broken
into

sacked

and
burned
in
london

because
they
were


full
of
valuables
to
be
looted

as
the
drama
went
on

other
passions


came
into
play

passions
not
less
but
more
ignoble
than
the
mere
savage


lust
of
plunder
and
destruction

a
branded
rogue
and
libeller

brissot



hurried
back
from
his
exile
beyond
the
atlantic
to
compete
with
camille


desmoulins
in
that
noble
work
of

denouncing

his
fellow
citizens

which


earned
for
camille
the
ghastly
title
of


procureur
de
la
lanterne





madame
roland


the
soul
of
the
gironde


sustained

inspired

and


animated
that
most
mischievous
group
with
all
the
concentrated
fires
of


envy

jealousy

and
revenge

which
had
smouldered
in
her
own
heart
from


the
time
when

as
a
girl
of
seventeen

she
had
passed
a
week

in
the


garrets

of
the
palace
at
versailles
with
madame
le
grand

one
of
the


tirewomen
of
the
dauphiness

the
firmness
with
which
madame
roland
met


her
own
fate
on
the
scaffold
has
been
sufficiently
celebrated
in
poetry


and
in
prose

but
it
is
wholesome
also
to
remember
the
ferocity
with


which

in
the

glorious

month
of
july



a
fortnight
after
the


capture
of
the
bastille

she
clamoured
for
the
blood
of
marie
antoinette


and
louis
xvi

in

marie
phlipon

the
engraver
s
daughter

a
girl
of


seventeen

educated

as
her
own
memoirs
tell
us

on

candide


the



confessions
of
rousseau


and
the

adventures
of
the
chevalier
de


faublas


came
away
from
versailles
so
gangrened
with
envy
of
the


glittering
personages
among
whom
she
had
been
condemned
to
play
the
part


of
a
humble
spectator

that

she
knew
not
what
to
do
with
the
hatred
in


her
heart


in

she
took
as
her
husband
m

roland

a
small


government
official

he
styled
himself
m

roland
de
la
platiere

from


the
name
of
a
small
estate
which
belonged
not
to
him
but
to
his
elder


brother

an
excellent
priest
and
canon
of
villefranche

who

by
the
way



was
guillotined
at
lyons
in



and
in

his
young
wife
made
him


take
her
to
paris

where
they
spent
some
time
in
vain
efforts
to
secure


letters
patent
of
nobility

the
efforts
failing

they
went
back
to
live


at
lyons

where
m

roland
was
an
inspector
of
manufactories

and
from


lyons

in
july



madame
roland

now
become
at
last
a
most


classical
republican

wrote
to
her
friend
m

bosc

who
afterwards


published
her
memoirs


a
letter
denouncing
the
timidity
of
their


political
friends


your
enthusiasm


she
exclaims


is
only
a
fire
of


straw


if
the
national
assembly
does
not
regularly
bring
to
trial
two


illustrious
heads

or
if
some
generous
imitators
of
decius
do
not
strike


them
down

you
will
all
go
to
the
devil








i
soften
and
tone
down
the
final
phrase
of
this
extraordinary
outburst



for
though
in
the
original
it
is
but
an
indecorum
as
compared
with
that


famous
passage
in
the

memoirs
of
madame
roland

which
m

de


sainte
beuve
gracefully
describes
as

an
immortal
act
of
indecency


it


is
yet
an
indecorum
of
a
sort
more
tolerable
in
the
french
than
in
the


english
tongue

if
the
style
is
the
man

the
style
is
also
the
woman

in



marie
phlipon

knew
not
what
to
do
with
the
hatred
in
her
heart




in

marie
roland

then
on
the
eve
of
her
appearance
upon
the
public


stage
of
the
revolution

had
found

what
to
do
with
the
hatred
in
her


heart







in
this
letter
to
bosc
we
have
the

soul
of
the
gironde


tout
entiere
a


sa
proie
attachee


she
clung
to
her
regicide
purpose
with
the
tenacity


of
a
tigress

everything
which
furthered
it
she
approved

everything


which
retarded
it
she
denounced

when
the
king
and
queen
were
brought


back
captives
from
varennes
to
paris
in
june

she
wrote

in
an


ecstasy
of
delight

to
bancal
des
issarts

that

thirty
or
forty


thousand
national
guards
surrounded
our
great
brigands


and
her
desire


was
that

the
royal
mannikin
should
be
shut
up

and
his
wife
brought
to


trial


she
was
then
inclined
to
favour
the
scheme
of
a
regency

of


which
her
ally
petion
should
be
the
chief

we
know
from
his
own


nauseating
account
of
his
conduct
while
journeying
back
from
varennes
to


paris
with
the
unfortunate
royal
family

how
unbridled
were
petion
s


dreams
of
his
own
probable
share
in
this
regency

and
by
a
very
curious


coincidence
a
passage
in
the
diary
of
gouverneur
morris
confirms

on
the


authority
of
vicq
d
azyr

the
queen
s
physician

petion
s
odious


revelations
of
his
own
vanity
and
vulgarity






under
the
spell
of
this
scheme
madame
roland
seems
for
a
time
to
have


suspended
her
merciless
pursuit
of
the
sovereign
whom
she
hated

she


even
got
so
far
as
almost
to
regret
the
failure
of
the
royal
fugitives


to
escape

why

because
their
escape

would
have
made
civil
war


inevitable


these
are
her
own
words
in
a
letter
written
to
bancal
des


issarts

june





we
can
only
be
regenerated
by
blood


this
was


the
horrible
core
of
her
republican
creed






it
made
her
the
ally

the
accomplice

the
apologist
by
turns
of
all
the


most
sanguinary
wretches
who
grasped
at
power
in
her
distracted


country

of
marat

when
in
a
spasm
of
unusual
energy
la
fayette
sought


to
suppress
his
abominable
journal

of
robespierre

whose
eventual


triumph
was
to
seal
her
own
fate
and
that
of
all
her
personal
friends



including
the
one
man
whom
in
all
her
life
she
seems
to
have


passionately
loved

and
of
danton

red
with
the
blood
of
the
helpless


prisoners
butchered
in
these
massacres
of
september


of
which
her


husband

then
a
member
of
what
called
itself
a

government

in
france



did
not
hesitate
publicly

and
under
his
official
signature

to
speak
to


the
people
of
paris
in
these
terms


i
admired
the
th
of
august

i


shuddered
at
the
consequences
of
the
nd
of
september


at
the


consequences
of
the
horrors
that
day
perpetrated

as
m

edmond
bire
very


aptly
points
out

not
at
all
at
the
horrors
themselves



i
well


understood
what
must
come
of
the
long
deceived
patience
and
of
the


justice
of
the
people

i
did
not
inconsiderately
blame
a
first
terrible


movement

but
i
thought
that
it
was
well
to
prevent
its
being
kept
up



and
those
who
sought
to
perpetuate
it
were
deceived
by
their


imagination







this
monstrous
language
was
used
by
roland
in
a
placard
published
on
the


walls
of
paris
on
september


the
massacres
had
not
then
really


ceased

and
the

first
terrible
movement

seemed
likely
to
be
followed


by
a
second
not
less

terrible


which
might
make
things
dangerous

not


for
the
prisoners
huddled
under
lock
and
key
only

but
for
certain


members
of
the
legislative
assembly

the
girondists
themselves






is
it
conceivable
that
now

after
a
hundred
years

rational
beings


should
look
back
with
any
feelings
but
those
of
contempt
and
horror
upon


these

patriots

of


madame
roland


the
soul
of
the
gironde


was


simply
the
soul
of
a
conspiracy
of
ambitious
criminals
masquerading
in


the
guise
of
philanthropists
and
philosophers

there
is
something


biblical
in
the
dramatic
completeness
of
the
chastisement
which
overtook


this
unhappy
woman


they
that
take
the
sword
shall
perish
by
the


sword







the
murder
of
the
king

which
madame
roland
did
so
much
to
compass

led


not
indirectly
to
the
ruin
of
her
own
most
trusted
political
friends
and


associates

the
murder
of
the
queen

for
which
she
had
longed
and


laboured

was
brought
to
pass

on
october




by
men
who
had
then


made
up
their
minds
to
send
herself
to
the
scaffold

and
who
sent
her
to


it

three
weeks
afterwards

on
november




in
the
ridiculous


revolutionary
calendar
of
the
epoch

this
date
stood
as
the
th


brumaire

year
ii

it
was
celebrated
six
years
afterwards
on
the
th


brumaire
of
the
year
viii

of
the
republic

by
the
advent
to
supreme


authority
of
the
corsican
soldier
who
was
to
found
a
despotic
empire


upon
the
results
of
that

universal
war

into
which
france
had
been


insanely
driven
by

the
soul
of
the
gironde


a
mere
coincidence

of


course

it
was
a
mere
coincidence

too

that
the
girondist



dufriche
valaze

who

at
the
trial
of
louis
xvi


especially
gratified


the
personal
malignity
of
madame
roland
by
the
insolence
with
which
he


treated
the
royal
captive

should
have
tried
to
save
his
own
head
when


he
and
his
comrades
at
last
were
writhing
in
the
iron
grip
of


robespierre

by
eagerly
denouncing
his
friend
and
associate

valady

as


the
real
author
of
a
particularly
virulent
placard
intended
by
the


girondists
to
turn
the
fury
of
the
parisian
mob
against
the
jacobins



seeing
that
he
had
disgraced
himself
to
no
purpose

the
wretched


creature

who
had
contrived
to
conceal
a
dagger
about
his
person

drew


it
out
when
the
merciless
prosecutor

fouquier
tinville

rising
in
his


place

demanded

on
october




that
all
the
girondists
then
on


trial

having
been
found
guilty
by
the
jury

though
no
plea
had
been


heard
in
their
defence

and
the
judge
had
not
summed
up

should
be


instantly
condemned
to
suffer
death
and
the
confiscation
of
their


property
under
the
law
of
december




a
law
passed
by
the


girondists
themselves

and
highly
approved
by

the
soul
of
the
gironde







unobserved
in
the
general
excitement
valaze
drove
the
dagger
into
his


heart

and
crying
out


i
am
a
dead
man


fell
bleeding
to
the
floor



when
his
companions
had
been
removed
by
the
guards

fouquier
tinville


rose
again
in
his
place

and
requested
that
the
tribunal
would
order
the


corpse
before
them
to
be
taken
with
the
living
criminals
to
the
place
de


la
revolution

and
there
with
them

guillotined







from
this
even
the
convention
shrank

but
the
dead
body
of
valaze
was
in


fact
carried
in
a
little
cart
through
the
streets
of
paris

behind
the


dismal
cortege
of
the
condemned


lying
stretched
upon
the
back

and
the


face
uncovered


on
october


after
the
execution
was
over
it
was


flung

with
the
remains
of
his
companions

into
a
great
pit






this
was
the
end

for
madame
roland
and
her
worshippers

in
four
short


years

of
the

great
reformation

of
which

on
may




she
had


written
to
one
of
her
friends
that
it
could
only
be
carried
through
by



burning
many
more
chateaux







for
france

and
the
french
people

the
end
of
it

i
fear

has
not
yet


come






rapine
and
confiscation
have
not
been
unknown

unfortunately

in
the


history
of
any
civilised
state

but
under
what
modern
government



excepting
the
government
of
the
first
french
republic

has
sheer


pillage

mere
downright
robbery

been
recognised
as
a
legitimate


instrument
of
political
propagandism

and

in
fact

as
a
title
to


property

while
the
girondists
predominated
in
france

brissot



self
styled
de
warville

was
their
avowed
leader

and
brissot

ten
years


before
the
revolution

in
his

philosophic
researches
into
the
rights
of


property

and
robbery
considered
in
the
light
of
nature


published
at


chartres
in


had
laid
it
down
as
a
great
principle
that

exclusive


ownership
is

in
nature

a
real
crime



our
institutions


said
this


worthy
man


punish
theft

which
is
a
virtuous
action

commended
by


nature
herself


clearly
such

institutions

needed
a
great
reformation



it
came

france
was

regenerated
by
blood


and
the
disciples
of


rousseau
widened
the
area
of
human
happiness

not
by
burning
only

but


by

looting

all
the
houses
they
could
break
into






the
chateaux
having
been
duly
pillaged
and
burned

and
their
owners


driven
to
fly
for
their
lives

the
government

controlled
by
the



principles

of
brissot

made
emigration
a
crime

seized
the
remaining


property
of
the

emigrants


and
turned
it
over
with
a
national
title



to
other
people






a
most
interesting
and
valuable
chapter
in
history
is
still
to
be


written
on
the
relation
of
the
french
revolution
to
property
in
france



such
a
history
cannot
be
written
by
the
unassisted
light
of
the
statutes


and
the
code

family
records

private
correspondence

the
reports
and


despatches
of
the
diplomatic
agents
of
the
successive
french
governments


between

and


must
all
be
laid
under
contribution

if
we
are
to


get
at
the
truth
concerning
the
conditions
under
which
a
very
large


proportion
of
the
land
of
france
passed
during
that
period

from
the


ownership
of
men
who
had
much
to
lose
by
the
changes
of
the
revolution



into
the
ownership
of
men
who
had
everything
to
gain
from
those
changes






the
landed
proprietors
of
france
were
driven
into
emigration

not
that


france
might
be
free

for
france
was
much
more
free
before
the


emigration
began
in

than
she
was
in


but
that
other
people


might
get
possession
of
their
estates

without
understanding
this

it
is


impossible
to
understand
some
of
the
most
atrocious
measures
adopted



chiefly
while
the
girondists
were
masters

first
by
the
legislative


assembly

and
then
by
the
convention

in
regard
to

emigrants







this
subject
was
evidently
dealt
with
in
the
assembly
and
the


convention

as
the
american
colonel
swan
discovered

in


that
the


tobacco
question
was
dealt
with


by
a
knot
of
men
who
disposed
of
all


things
as
they
liked

and
who
turned
everything
to
account







on
october




for
example

a
decree
was
adopted
inflicting
the


penalty
of
death
on
any
emigrant
who
should
return
to
france

a


fortnight
later

on
november




a
similar
decree
made
it
a


capital
offence
for
any

emigrant

to
enter
a
french
colony






the
first
of
these
decrees
was
levelled
at
emigrants
whose
estates
had


been
seized
by
the

popular
societies

all
over
france

and
sold

or
put


in
the
way
of
being
sold

the
second
was
aimed
at
the
owners
of
estates


in
such
colonies
as
hayti

then
one
of
the
richest
and
most
flourishing



as
it
is
now
one
of
the
most
wretched
and
uncivilised
islands
in
the


world

a
curious

minute
book

of
the

friends
of
liberty

at


port
au
prince

which
was
given
to
me
in

by
an
old
french
resident


of
santo
domingo

contains
a
list
of
the
great
proprietors
of
the


island

annotated
and
marked
in
a
way
which
indicates
that
a
systematic


plan
of
action
against
them
was
either
then
adopted

or
about
to
be


adopted

by
the
agents
of
the

friends

at
paris

as
the
spoliation
went


on

the
decrees
became
more
and
more
draconian

in
march
and
april




it
was
decreed
that

any
person
convicted
of
emigration

or
any
priest


within
the
category
of
priests
ordered
to
be
transported

who
should
be


found
on
french
territory

should
be
put
to
death
within
twenty
four


hours


as
in
many
cases
the
question
of
the
crime
of
emigration
was
to


be
decided
by
persons
actually
enjoying
the
property
of
the
alleged


emigrant

this
short
shrift
was
a
most
effectual

warranty
of
title







on
march




it
was
decreed
that


any
young
girl

aged
fourteen



or
more

who

having
emigrated

should
have
come
back
and
have
then
been


sent
out
of
france
by
the
authorities

and
who
should
return
to
france
a


second
time

should
be
forthwith

put
to
death



this
is
perhaps
the


most
shamelessly
felonious
of
all
these
felonious
decrees

adopted

be


it
remembered

while
madame
roland
was
still
the

soul
of
the
gironde




and
still
taking
an
active
part
in
the
preparation
and
promulgation
of


all
the
acts
of
the
state






the
object
of
this
abominable
decree
was
obvious






in
some
cases
the
property
of
families
in
france
was
actually
saved
and


carried
through
the
tempest
of
the
revolution
by
young
girls

who


fearlessly
faced
all
the
horrors
of
the
time

remained
in
their
homes



and

supported
by
a
few
faithful
friends
and
servants

such
as
for
the


credit
of
human
nature
and
the
confusion
of
schopenhauer

are
really


sometimes
to
be
found
doing
their
duty
in
such
emergencies

successfully


maintained
their
right
to
the
estates
of
their
fathers

near
the


picturesque
old
capital
of
le
puy
in
the
haute
loire

mademoiselle
irene


de
tencin

after
her
father
was
driven
from
his
chateau

remained
there


with
her
young
brother
and
a
few
loyal
servants

maintained
her
rights



collected
what
money
she
could

bought

assignats

for
gold

and
so


bought
back
the
confiscated
land
and
the
furniture
of
her
home

a
tailor


of
le
puy
wished
to
marry
her

and
the

republican

council
threatened


her
with
death
if
she
refused


death
on
the
spot


she
replied

then


they
actually
locked
her
up
in
prison
for
a
year

but
she
held
out
to


the
end
and
carried
her
young
brother
safely
through
until
the
days
of


law
came
back

the
decree
of
march




condemning
girls
of
fourteen


to
death
in
certain
cases

was
intended
to
prevent

emigrants

from


sending
back
any
more
daughters
of
this
type
to
france

to
represent
the


rights
of
the
family






about
this
there
can
be
no
manner
of
doubt

could
a
more
signal
proof


than
this
decree
affords
be
given
of
the
essentially
predatory
and


criminal
direction
which
was
given
to
the
domestic
policy
of
france
by


the

knot
of
men
who
disposed
of
all
things
as
they
liked

and
who


turned
everything
to
account


they
had
their
tentacles
out
all
over


france

the

societes
populaires


of
which
i
have
seen
it
stated
by


writers
of
authority
that
no
fewer
than


existed

and
were
at
work


in


served
them
everywhere

the
local
leaders
of
these

societies



of
course
sharing
with
them
in
the
general
booty
according
to
their


several
deserts






the
story
of
a
single
family
in
provence

as
told
in
an
admirable


monograph
by
m

forneron

illustrates
perfectly
the
methods
and
the


results
of
this
organisation
of
confiscation
in
the
name
of
patriotism


and
philanthropy






when
the
states
general
were
summoned
in

the
marquis
de
saporta

a


kinsman
of
the
great
house
of
crillon

now
represented
by
the
duchesse


d
uzes

was
the
seigneur
of
montsallier

a
domain
near
the
ancient
and


picturesque
little
city
of
apt
between
avignon
and
vaucluse

his
own


estate
was
large

and
he
had
greatly
increased
it
in


by
marrying
a


daughter
of
one
of
the
richest
planters
in
hayti

like
many
other
men
of


his
rank
at
that
time

he
was
an
ardent
admirer
of
jean
jacques


rousseau

and
a
firm
believer
in
the
native
nobility
and
general


perfectibility
of
man

he
was
a
very
popular
landlord

and
his


generosity
was
equal
to
his
wealth

during
six
months
of
a
severe
famine


he
fed
the
peasants
of
montsallier
at
his
own
expense

he
was
one
of
the


believers
in
madame
de
stael
s
man
of
destiny

her
father

the
genevese


banker

necker

in
november

he
was
elected
constitutional
mayor
of


apt

and
inducted
into
office

with
much
applause

by
a
solemn
service


in
the
parish
church

in
february


a
local
patriot
named
reboulin


surnamed
the

roman


and
an
armourer
named
thiebault
who
had
joined
the


marseilles
club

and
consequently
were
in
correspondence
with
paris



organised
a
systematic
attack
upon
the
marquis


this
man


they
said


at
marseilles


is
an
enemy
of
the
constitution
by
reason
of
his
rank


and
of
his
rage
at
what
is
going
on

he
is
a

ci
devant

noble

who


became
mayor
by
intrigues
and
cabals







from
that
moment
no
peace
was
given
to
the
saporta
family
till

one
by


one

they
were
driven
out
of
france

the
marquis
held
out
bravely
as


long
as
he
could

and
was
the
last
to
leave

when
his
wife
left
he
gave


her
a
passport
signed
by
himself
as
mayor

in
which
he
described
her
as


the

citoyenne
laporte


the
object
of
this
being
that
no
evidence


should
exist
to
show
that
madame
de
saporta
had
really

emigrated


in


default
of
such
evidence
there
was
some
chance
that
her
property
rights


might
be
respected






after
the
fall
of
the
directory
the
saportas
ventured
to
come
back

and


in

they
finally
recovered
so
much
of
their
property
as
had
not


before
that
time
been
sold

by
the
state


there
was
not
much
left

a


sister
of
the
marquis

the
marquise
d
eyragues

who
had
enjoyed
a
very


large
income
before
the
revolution

wrote
to
her
nephew
in

that
she


esteemed
herself
very
happy
to
recover
a

house
to
live
in
and
two


thousand
francs
a
year







here
in
this
beautiful
region
around
laon
and
chauny
and
coucy

the


story
of
those
evil
days
is
told
almost
as
instructively
by
the


properties
which
then
escaped
ruin
as
by
those
which

like
the
estate
of


the
saportas

were
confiscated
and
broken
up






in
the
eighteenth
century
it
was
full
of
fine
buildings

chateaux



churches

monasteries

hospitals

go
where
you
please

you
come
upon
the


sites
of
edifices

once
local
centres
of
civilisation

which
were


pillaged

burned

and
demolished

while
the

national
agents

ruled
the


provinces
for
the
benefit
of
the
speculators
at
paris

here
stood
the


stately
chateau
de
molerepaire

of
which
nothing
now
remains
but
a


farmhouse

there

the
ancient
parish
church
of
st

paul
at


mons
en
laonnois

one
of
the
finest
in
the
district

now
utterly
gone



all
its
materials
having
been
sold
for
the
profit
of
certain

national


agents

in


wissignicourt
possessed
in

one
of
the
most


beautiful
churches
in
northern
france
and
two
considerable
chateaux

the


church
of
st

remi
was
first
robbed
of
all
its
ornaments

and
finally



in


completely
demolished






the
chateau
de
la
cressonniere

built
in
the
sixteenth
century
by
claude


de
massary

and
inhabited
by
his
descendants
as
resident
landlords
until


the
revolution

has
entirely
disappeared

of
the
chateau
de


wissignicourt

founded
in
the
twelfth
century
by
a
baron
of
the
great


picard
family
of
de
hangest

some
portions
still
exist

but
this
little


commune

which
occupies
one
of
the
most
naturally
charming
sites
in
the


laonnois

between
anizy
and
laon

is
indebted
to
the

patriots

of


chauny

who
domineered
over
it
during
the
revolution

for
the


annihilation
of
local
features

which
in
these
days
of
railway
travel


and
picturesque
tourists
would
have
materially
enhanced
the
value
of
its


not
very
fertile
territory

these
buildings

these
chateaux
and


churches

were
part
of
the
accumulated
capital
of
france

and
certainly


not
the
least
important
part
of
the
accumulated
capital
of
the
commune


of
wissignicourt

if
they
had
been
destroyed
in
the
heat
of
conflict

as


so
many
such
buildings
were
destroyed
in
this
country
during
the
wars
of


religion

and
in
germany

and
even
in
great
britain

the
philosophers


might
have
some
plausible
pretext
at
least
for
citing
their
favourite


proverb
that
you

cannot
make
an
omelette
without
breaking
some
eggs




and
we
might
be
invited
to
set
off

against
this
loss
of
accumulated


capital

certain
important
gains
in
the
way
of
more
liberal


institutions
and
an
enfranchised
industry

but
this
is
not
the
case



the
vandalism
of
the
revolution
of

was
perpetrated
in
cold
blood

i


speak

of
course

now
of
the
real
authors
of
it
all

at
paris

not
of


the
mere
mobs
in
the
provinces

hot
with
the
sordid
lust
of
plunder
or


with
personal
spites
and
rancours

and
it
was
perpetrated
for
the
profit


of
those
who
promoted
it

the
bronzes
and
brasses
and
lead
and
hammered


iron
of
the
desecrated
churches
were
turned
into
money

and
the
money


went
into
the
pockets
of
the

patriots


monuments
that
would
now
be


priceless
were
destroyed

for
example

at
st

denis

not
in
the
least


that
the
metal
might
be
cast
into
cannon

i
am
told
the
military
records


show
that
the
republican
armies
fought
their
battles

when
finally
they


got
to
fighting
them

exclusively
with
the
artillery
of
the


monarchy

but
that
the
metal
might
be
sold
in
the
markets

and
the


proceeds
confiscated
by
the
vendors

certain
rogues
at
chauny
and
their


employers
in
paris
were
doubtless
the
richer
a
hundred
years
ago
for
the


desecration
of
the
church
of
st

remi
and
the
pillage
of
la
cressonniere


and
the
chateau
de
wissignicourt

but
wissignicourt
and
its
people
are


the
poorer
to
day
for
these
performances






an
instructive
estimate
might
be
made
of
the
dead
loss
which
the
little


city
of
bourg
en
bresse
would
have
sustained
during
the
past
century
if


the
sensible
savoyards
of
that
place
had
not
cunningly
protected
the


magnificent
statue
tombs
of
marguerite
d
autriche

marguerite
de
bourbon


and
philibert
le
beau
in
their
grand
old
church
of
notre
dame
de
brou



against
the
rapacity
of
the
revolutionary

operators


by
cramming
the


whole
church
full
of
straw
and
hay






soissons

in
reality
one
of
the
very
oldest
cities
in
france

the
seat



when
caesar
first
assailed
it

of
a
gallic
prince

whose
authority


extended
beyond
the
channel
into
britain

and
the
cradle
long


afterwards
of
the
first
frankish
monarchy

might
be
taken

so
far
as


its
general
aspect
goes

for
a
creation
of
the
second
empire

were
it


not
for
its
beautiful
old
cathedral

sadly
damaged
in


but


very
successfully
restored

and
for
the
graceful
towers
of


st

jean
des
vignes

these
latter
were
rescued
with
extreme
difficulty


by
the
townspeople
themselves
from
the
felonious
fury
of
the
democratic


operators

who
despoiled
their
city
for
ever
of
all
the
rest
of
that


superb
castellated
abbey

of
st

medard
without
the
walls

which

were


it
now
standing

would
be
to
the
history
of
the
french
people
what


winchester
cathedral
is
to
the
history
of
the
english

only
the


subterranean
chapels
remain

the
materials
and
the
contents
of
the
abbey


itself
were
turned
into
cash






st

medard
lez
soissons
was
only
one
of
eighteen
considerable


benedictine
abbeys
which
down
to
the
revolution
existed
within
the


limits
of
the
modern
department
of
the
aisne
of
which
laon
is
the
chief


town

besides
these

this
region

the
early
reclamation
and
cultivation


of
which

as
i
have
already
said

was
chiefly
due
to
the
monastic


orders

possessed

before


sixteen
abbeys
and
monasteries
of
the


premonstratensians

the
mother
abbey
of
this
great
order

founded
by


saint
norbert
in
the
twelfth
century

commemorates
in
its
name
the
great


agricultural
work
done
by
him
and
his
disciples

premontre


the
meadows


of
the
monastery


was
the
chief
seat
of
the
order
which
a
hundred
years


ago
comprised
more
than
eighteen
hundred
monasteries

the


chapters
general
of
which
were
held
here

the
vast
and
stately
buildings


of
presmontre
are
still
standing

they
were
constructed
on
a
scale
of


royal
grandeur

worthy
of
the
order

under
the
abbe
de
muyn

towards
the


end
of
the
reign
of
louis
xiv


and
they
much
resemble
the
buildings


erected
at
the
same
time
at
the
grande
chartreuse

near
grenoble

like


these

they
were
seized
upon
in

by
the
revolutionists

but
in
both


cases
the
buildings
were
saved

those
of
the
grande
chartreuse
because


there
was
no
temporal
use
to
which
they
could
be
put

standing

as
they


do

high
up
above
the
gorges
of
the
guier

in
their
glorious
solitude


amid
the
pine
forests
of
dauphine

and
these
of
premontre
for
exactly


the
opposite
reason

because
they
were
available
for
purposes
more


profitable
than
the
sale
of
their
materials
was
likely
to
be

they
were


converted
first
into
a
saltpetre
factory
by
the
little
knot
of
financial


operators
who
bought
them
for
a
song
as

national
property


afterwards


an
attempt
was
made
to
establish
glassworks
in
them

then
they
became
an


orphan
asylum

and
now
they
are
a
great
asylum
for
lunatics






st

jean
des
vignes
at
soissons

already
mentioned

was
the
only


monastery
of
the
joannists
in
france

and
it
was
one
of
fifteen


cistercian
abbeys
in
this
region

the
remaining
ruins
of
the
church
of


one
of
these
cistercian
abbeys
at
longpont

near
soissons

vindicate
its


ancient
fame
as
one
of
the
jewels
of
french
religious
architecture

it


was
built
under
st

louis

and
consecrated
in
his
presence

it
shared



in


the
fate
of
the
almost
equally
beautiful
church
of
st

leger
at


soissons

the
apse

transepts

and
cloisters
of
which

even
in
their


present
condition

suffice
to
show
what
soissons
lost
when
it
was
looted


and
desecrated

a
worthy
bishop
of
soissons

m

de
garsignies

bought


what
remained
of
st

leger
in


and
established
there
a
seminary






add
to
these
edifices
those
of
twelve
commanderies
of
the
temple

ten


commanderies
of
st

john
of
jerusalem

two
chartreuses

ten
collegiate


churches

and
more
than
a
hundred
and
fifty
priories

nunneries

and


other
religious
communities

and
it
will
be
seen
what
a
grand
field
of


enterprise
and
speculation
was
thrown
open
in
the
laonnais
and
the


soissonnais
to
the
disciples
of
brissot
de
warville
and
of
condorcet
by


the
seizure
of
the
church
property
alone






scarcely
less
numerous
than
the
religious
edifices
in
this
region
were


the
chateaux

of
these
comparatively
few
are
now
standing

either
as


picturesque
ruins
or
as
residences

the
bas
reliefs
and
tapestry
of
the


ancient
buildings
of

of

are
still


worthy

the

famous

maltreated
in



as
to
be
quite
uninhabitable
when
the
first
napoleon
passed
a
night


there

during
his
final
struggle
for

and
there
still
is
to
be


seen
the
old
lombard
roman
church
of
st

wherein
was
held
a


council
strong
enough
to
coerce
philip

into
doing
what
henry

refused

three
centuries
afterwards

to
do

and
to
make
him

what

ruthlessly
battered

abused
in


and
robbed
of

matchless

the

of
a
syndicate


of

were
those
of

of

the
first
still

and
stands
substantially
as


it
then
stood

and
is
now
admittedly
the
finest
in
the
laonnais

the


second
was
wrecked
and
demolished

it
is
perhaps
worth
while
to
tell


what
befell
anizy

and
how
pinon
escaped






both
anizy
and
pinon
are
of
very
ancient
origin






anizy
seems
to
have
been
a
fortress
of
the
emperor
valentinian
in
the


fourth
century

and
it
was
pillaged
by
the
vandals
in
the
fifth

on


december

in
recognition
of
the
baptism
he
had
received


on
the
preceding
day
at
the
hands
of
st

in

cathedral

of

gave

lordships
of
anizy

coucy

and
leuilly
to
that
prelate



two
years
afterwards
st

remi

who
had
made
laon
a
bishopric

gave
anizy


to
his
nephew
st

genebaud

the
first
bishop
of
laon

to
be
held
and
the


revenues
thereof
to
be
applied
by
the
bishops
of
laon
for
ever
to
the


benefit
of
the
poor
of
that
diocese

he
coupled
the
gift
with
a
solemn


curse
and
anathema
upon
all
who
should
ever
disturb
or
misapply
the


donation

from
that
time
to

anizy
was
a
lordship
of
the
bishops
of


laon

who
in
time
were
made
dukes
and
peers
of
france






the
annals
of
laon
attest
the
loyalty
through
long
ages
of
the
bishops


of
laon
to
the
injunctions
laid
upon
them
by
st

remi

the
normans
came


to
anizy

for
example

in


and
pillaged
and
ruined
the
place

four


years
afterwards
the
bishop
of
laon
founded
there
a
hospital

or


hotel
dieu

for
the
poor
and
infirm
of
the
diocese

and
the
king



charles
le
gros

endowed
it
handsomely

in

jeanne

sister
of
raoul



bishop
of
laon

with
the
help
of
her
brother

founded
at
anizy
a
priory


of
sisters
to
receive
and
care
for
the
young
girls
of
the
place

in




adalberon

bishop
of
laon

founded
a
maladrerie

or
lepers

hospital

at


anizy

to
be

a
refuge
and
place
of
healing
for
the
poor
of
anizy



wissignicourt

and
pinon







as
time
went
on
and
the
feudal
system
became
more
fully
developed

the


bishops
of
laon
found
it
judicious
to
establish
one
of
those
high
feudal


personages
known
as
vidames

and
the
relations
of
the
vidames
of
laon


with
their
episcopal
superior

on
the
one
hand

and
with
the
people
of


such
lordships
as
anizy
on
the
other

become
very
interesting






they
are
made
more
interesting
still
by
the
entrance
upon
the
scene
of


the
kings
of
france

contending
for
a
real
royal
authority

of
great


barons
like
the
sires
de
coucy
bent
on
getting
a
complete
local


independence
of
any
central
government

and
of
the
people
of
the


communes

who
very
early
saw
their
own
game
as
between
the
church

the


barons

and
the
king

and
played
it
here

as
in
so
many
other
places



with
most
respectable
skill
and
success

there
is
a
picturesque
story
of


pope
benedict
viii


who
held
a
council
at
laon

going
from
laon
to
view


the
episcopal
chateau
at
anizy

with
a

cortege

of
cardinals
and


bishops

and
on
the
way
springing
down
nimbly
from
his
horse
to
rescue


the
bishop
of
cambray

obviously
a
prelate
of
much
weight

under
whom
a


little
bridge
gave
way
as
they
were
crossing
the
river
lette

this
was


in
the
year


a
century
later

in


gandri

bishop
of
laon



summoned
john
comte
de
soissons

robert
ii

comte
de
flandre

and


enguerrand
i

sire
de
coucy

the
three
loftiest
and
lordliest
personages


then
of
this
part
of
the
world

to
a
conference
at
his
chateau
in
anizy



there
to
fix
and
define
where
the
authority
of
the
sire
de
coucy
ended


and
that
of
the
bishops
of
laon
began

in

the
burgh
of
anizy
became


a
free
commune
and
elected
its
first
mayor

the
next
year
its
seigneur



robert
de
chatillon

bishop
duke
of
laon

at
his
own
cost
fortified
the


place
with
walls
and
towers

and
did
this
so
well
that
three
years


afterwards
enguerrand
iii

de
coucy

just
then
the
most
masterful
person


in
all
this
part
of
france

thought
it
wise
to
treat
with
the


bishop
duke
as
to
their
respective
rights
of
ownership
in
the
adjoining


forest
of
roncelais

they
agreed
so
perfectly
that
the
formidable
lord


of
coucy
immediately
afterwards
did
the
bishop
duke
and
the
people
of


anizy
the
notable
service
of
leading
a
band
of
his
retainers
against
a


company
of
brigands
who
were
burning
lonely
farmhouses
and
carrying
off


the
crops






having
got
their
mayor
and
their
walls
and
their
towers

the
burghers
of


anizy
took
to
quarrelling
with
the
bishop
dukes
of
laon

and
so
got


their
communal
rights
suppressed
by
one
of
those
prelates
in


only


to
see
them
re
established
again
half
a
century
later
in


by


another
bishop
duke

geoffroi
de
beaumont

who
made
a
compromise
with


his
troublesome
vassals

reserving
only
to
himself
the
right
to
nominate


the
officers
of
justice

the
king
of
france

philippe
le
hardi

be
it


observed

took
sides
with
the
burghers
in
this
affair

and
they
raised
a


monument
to
him
in







this

with
almost
everything
else
of
any
importance
in
anizy

was


destroyed
by
the
english
of
edward
iii


in
the
next
century

one
of
the


local
seigneurs

the
lord
of
locq

where
a
chateau
still
represents
the


extinct
lordship

and
the
cure
of
the
church
of
st

peter
falling


valiantly
in
the
defence
of
their
people

the
bishop
duke
came
over
to


help
them
from
laon

and
died
in
his
chateau
at
anizy
the
next
year






in


another
bishop
duke
founded
a
free
market
at
anizy
for
three


days
in
each
year

at
the
feast
of
st

george

and
in

his
successor


built
a
grain
hall
there

in

louis
xii

granted
the
burghers
a
free


market
every
monday

this
so
incensed
the
then
bishop
duke

louis
de


bourbon
vendome

that
he
tried
to
suppress
the
annual
market
and
take


back
the
grain
hall

in
return
for
which
attempts
the
worthy
burghers


pillaged
his
chateau
at
anizy
and
pulled
it
nearly
to
pieces






clearly
the
seigneurs
did
not
have
things
all
their
own
way
in
these


good
old
times

for
after
several
years
of
contention
louis
de


bourbon
vendome
came
to
terms
with
his
burghers

and
matters
were
put


upon
so
friendly
a
footing
that

in


the
bishop
duke
began
the


erection
at
anizy
of
a
new
chateau

to
be
surrounded
with
an
extensive


and
beautiful
park

the
plans
were
made
by
the
first
architects
and


artists
of
the
renaissance

the
sculptors
of
francis
i

were
employed
to


decorate
the
facade
with
statues

the
new
buildings
were
connected
with


what
remained
of
the
earlier
chateau
by
a
grand
gallery

pavilions


flanked
the
main
edifice
and
adorned
the
grand
cour
d
honneur

king


francis

during
his
stay
at
folembray

frequently
visited
his
cousin
the


bishop
duke
in
this
chateau

one
of
the
great
chambers
of
which
was
long


known
as
the
room
of
king
francis

when
louis
de
bourbon
vendome
died


in


the
chateau
was
not
entirely
finished

and
a
lawsuit
followed


his
death

between
his
personal
heirs
and
the
bishop
dukes
for
the


possession
of
the
buildings

it
lasted
for
nearly
a
century

and
when


the
prelates
at
last
were
declared
to
be
the
owners

in


the


stately
edifice
had
fallen
into
a
sad
state
of
dilapidation

the


cardinal
d
estrees
restored
the
facade
in


but
one
of
his


successors
actually
unroofed
it
and
sold
the
lead

in


a


bishop
duke
of
quite
another
type

the
cardinal
de
rochechouart

spent


great
sums
of
money
upon
it

restored
it

and
decorated
it
throughout



and
made
it
one
of
the
noblest
residences
in
this
part
of
france

at
the


same
time
he
put
in
order
all
the
public
buildings
of
anizy

and
had
the


roads
carefully
paved
throughout
the
borough

he
was
followed
by
a


prelate
of
a
like
mind

louis
de
sabran

the
last
bishop
duke
of
laon



who
is
still
remembered
in
his
episcopal
city
for
his
public
spirit
and


his
benevolence

and
who
made
the
park
of
anizy
his
special
care






then
came
the
revolution






in


the
local

directory

of
the
district
of
chauny
laid
violent


hands
upon
the
chateau

it
was
in
great
part
demolished

and
what
was


left
of
it
defaced

it
was
robbed
of
its
precious
furniture

pictures



and
ornaments

its
valuable
chimney
pieces

its
elaborate
iron
and
brass


work

the
old
trees
were
cut
down
in
the
park

and
the
railings


destroyed

the
fine
old
church
of
ste

genevieve
at
the
same
time
was


first
turned
into
a
hall
of
meeting
for
the
electors

who
distrusted


each
other
so
profoundly
that
when
their
first
meeting
was
held

may






the
documents
relating
to
the
elections
were
locked
up
in
a


confessional

lest
they
should
be
stolen

and
then
deliberately
wrecked


and
looted
by
the

friends
of
liberty


or

in
other
words

by
a
squad


of
ruffians
from
chauny
and
the
neighbourhood

who

after
putting
on


the
sacerdotal
vestments

marched
about
the
church
carrying
the
dais



beat
the
crosses
and
the
carved
stalls
to
pieces

smashed
and
defaced


the
monuments
and
the
altars

broke
open
the
poor
box

and
carried
off


all
that
was
worth
stealing

the
stone
slabs
from
the
graves
were
sold



a
saltpetre
factory
was
established
in
the
church

the
presbytery
was


made
a
town
hall

and
the

worship
of
reason


in
the
person
of
a
young


woman
of
chauny

was
solemnly
inaugurated
at
anizy

the
chateau
and
the


park
were
sold
by
the
self
constituted
dictators
of
anizy
to
one
m

orry


de
sainte
marie
on
august




for
a
nominal
price

this
m

orry


seems
to
have
been
an

operator


for
in
june



he
sold
the
chateau


to
the

ci
devant
vicomtesse
de
courval


the
mother
of
the
then
owner


of
the
chateau
of
pinon

about
which
i
shall
presently
have
something
to


say

and
bought
it
back
from
her
again
in
march


leaving
her
the


right
to
enjoy
it
until
her
death

which
took
place
in


all
this


curiously
illustrates
the
perils
and
uncertainties
of
land
ownership
in


such
times

in


orry
de
sainte
marie

having
by
that
time
become
a


justice
of
the
peace
at
anizy

and
doubtless
a
fervent
imperialist

sold


the
chateau
to
m

collet

director
of
the
mint
at
paris

from
him
it


passed
by
sale

in


to
m

senneville

and
in

to
m

lafont
de


launoy






let
us
turn
now
to
pinon

two
kilometres
to
the
south
of
anizy

long
one


of
the
chief
seats
of
the
power
of
the
famous
sires
de
coucy

one
of


whom
seems
to
have
been
the
real
author
of
the
arrogant
motto
since

in


one
or
another
form

attributed
to
more
than
one
great
family
in
france










roi
ne
suis




ne
prince

ne
comte
aussy







je
suis
le
sire
de
coucy






the
chateau
of
pinon
was
originally
built
by
enguerrand
ii

of
coucy
in


the
twelfth
century

his
grandfather
enguerrand
i

had
been
invited
by


the
archbishop
of
reims
to
establish
himself
at
pinon

which
was
a
part


of
the
splendid
christmas
gift
made
by
clovis
to
the
see
of
reims

as
i


have
already
stated

after
his
baptism
at
reims

and
enguerrand
ii


who


appears
to
have
been
a
typical
baron

finding
the
place
favourable
for


the
feudal
industry
of
levying
toll
on
trade
and
commerce

there
erected


a
great
castle

one
of
the
many
legendary
castles
to
be
found
all
over


europe
which
boasted
a
window
for
every
day
in
the
year

he
thought
fit



however

to
select
for
this
castle
a
site
which
belonged
to
the
abbey
of


st

crispin
the
great
at
soissons

and
thus
got
himself
into
trouble


with
the
church

strong
as
he
was

he
found
the
church
too
strong
for


him

the
bishop
of
soissons
compelled
him
to
agree
to
pay
an
annual
and


perpetual
rent
to
the
abbey

and
made
him
also
take
the
cross
and
go
to


the
holy
land
to
expiate
his
sacrilege

there
he
fell
in
battle

the


grandson
of
this
baron

robert
de
coucy

in

granted
the
people
of


pinon

a
right
of
assize
according
to
the
use
and
custom
of
laon


and


the
next
year
founded
there
a
hospital

twenty
years
afterwards
pinon


became
a
commune

and
john
de
coucy
granted
the
inhabitants
a
free


market

the
chateau
of
pinon
passed
in
the
th
century
to
the
elder


branch
of
the
great
house
of
de
coucy

and
in

it
was
sold

under


duress
to
louis
of
france

duc
d
orleans

by
the
last
heiress
of
the


house
marie
de
coucy

daughter
of
enguerrand
vii

by
his
first
wife


isabel

princess
royal
of
england

and
eldest
daughter
of
edward
iii

by


philippa
of
hainault






a
hundred
years
afterwards
louis
xii

had
taken
possession
of
the


estates
and
the
chateau

and
made
a
gift
of
these
to
his
daughter


claude
de
france

in
spite
of
this

however

the
property
passed
into


the
hands
of
the
ancient
family
of
de
lameth

and
towards
the
end
of
the


seventeenth
century
the
chateau
de
pinon
witnessed
one
of
the
most


romantic
and
abominable
murders
recorded
in
the
annals
of
french


gallantry






as
pinon
is
still

after
all
the
chances
and
changes
of
seven
hundred


years

the
finest
inhabited
chateau
in
the
soissonnais

and
as

by
a


curious
throw
of
the
dice
of
destiny

it
now
belongs
to
a
fair


compatriot
of
mine

perhaps
i
may
be
allowed
to
tell
this
somewhat


gruesome
tale

which
has
a
flavour
rather
italian
than
french






charles
marquis
d
albret

the
last
of
that
illustrious
race

prince
de


mortagne
and
comte
de
massant

was
the
nephew
of
the
marechal
d
albret



and
he
came
therefore

on
the
mother
s
side

of
the
royal
blood
of
henry


of
navarre






he
loved

not
wisely
but
too
well

henriette
de
roucy

comtesse
de


lameth

called

la
belle
picarde


whose
husband
was
seigneur
of
the


chateau
de
pinon

in
august


the
marquis
d
albret
was
at
the


chateau
de
coucy
with
the
army
of
flanders

then
commanded
by
the


marshal
duke
of
schomberg

who
afterwards
fell
fighting
for
king
william


iii

in
ireland
at
the
battle
of
the
boyne






the
comte
de
lameth

who
had
in
some
way
discovered
the
relations
which


existed
between
his
wife


la
belle
picarde


and
the
marquis
d
albret



shut
the
comtesse
into
a
room
at
pinon

and
compelled
her

by
threats


and
violence

to
write
a
letter
to
the
marquis
giving
him
a
rendezvous


at
pinon

on
the
day
mentioned
in
her
letter
the
comte
de
lameth
ordered


six
horses
to
be
put
to
his
coach

and

having
previously
put
his
wife


under
watch
and
ward

drove
off
with
an
escort
to
laon

news
of
this
was


carried
at
once
to
coucy

the
marquis
set
forth
with
a
single
attendant


on
horseback
to
chavignon

where
at
the
hostelry
of
la
croix
blanche

he


was
met

as
from
the
letter
of
his
lady
love
he
expected
to
be

by
a


servant
from
the
chateau
de
pinon






armed
only
with
pistols
in
his
holsters

he
mounted
after
dark
and
rode


on
from
chavignon
to
pinon

there

as
he
entered
the
park
gates

just


after
midnight

three
men

one
of
them
jocquet

the
valet
de
chambre
of


the
comte
de
lameth

sallied
out
upon
him
from
under
an
archway

and



feigning
to
take
him
for
a
robber

opened
fire
upon
him

he
killed
one


of
his
assailants

and
then
himself
fell






about
fifty
years
ago

the
then
proprietor
of
pinon
was
building
a
lodge


for
one
of
his
keepers
when
the
workmen
came
upon
a
gold
ring
in
digging


for
the
foundation

it
bore
the
engraved
name
of
d
albret

and
the
name


of
the
royal
regiment
which
he
commanded

he
had
doubtless
been
buried


where
he
fell
in
the
park






this
proprietor
was
the
father
of
the
late
baron
de
courval

formerly
an


officer
in
the
french
army

who

during
the
second
empire

married
miss


ray
of
new
york






the
de
courvals
became
possessors
of
pinon
through
the
murder
of
the


marquis
d
albret

the
way
in
which
this
came
about
curiously
illustrates


the
course
of
justice
and
injustice
under
the

ancien
regime


this


differed
more
in
form
than
in
fact
from
the
course
of
justice
and


injustice
in
our
own
time

claude

comte
de
lameth

the
jealous
husband


of

la
belle
picarde


was
a
great
personage

not
only
comte
de
lameth


but
vicomte
de
laon

d
anizy

de
marchy

and
de
croix

and
seigneur
of


bayencourt

pinon

bouchavannes

clacy

laniscourt

quincy



et
autres


lieux



but
the
marquis
d
albret
was
a
greater
personage
still

and


the
widow
of
the
marquis

who
refused
to
believe
the
story
of
his
affair


with

la
belle
picarde


was
a

dame
d
atours

of
the
queen

marie


therese

so
also
was
the
cousin
german
of
the
marquis

and
these
two


dames
made
such
a
clamour
about
the
murder
that
the
king

louis
xiv




and
of
course
with
the
king
the
whole
court

so
waged
war
against
the


comte
de
lameth
that
his
whole
family
found
it
wise
to
seek
safety
in


flight

and
fearing
the
confiscation
of
all
his
property

the
comte



whose
wife
had
previously
gone
into
an
ursuline
convent

sold
the


estate
and
chateau
of
pinon

with
other
estates

to
his
friend
pierre


dubois
de
courval

president
of
the
parliament
of
paris















the
venom
of
this
old
history
recurs
in
the
revolution







poisoning
the
minds
of
three
lameths

concerning
whom
mr

carlyle






indulges
in
much
quite
unnecessary
and
grotesque
emotion






in

dubois
de
courval
pulled
down
the
ancient
chateau
de
pinon

and



on
the
designs
of
mansard

built
the
present
stately
and
imposing


edifice

le
notre
laid
out
for
him
also
the
extensive
park

and

when
he


died

in


he
left
coucy
la
ville
and
fresnes
to
his
elder
son

and


to
his
younger

with
the
title
of
vicomte
de
courval

the
chateau
and


estates
of
pinon






it
was
the
widow
of
this
younger
son

aime
louis
dubois
de
courval

who



as
i
have
already
said

saved
what
could
be
saved
of
the
chateau
of


anizy
in

by
buying
it
from
the
enterprising
m

orry
de


sainte
marie






her
husband

a
man
of
worth
and
of
note
in
the
parliament
of
paris

died


on
the
very
eve
of
the
great
troubles

december




he
was
then
in


his
sixty
seventh
year

and
as
he
had
done
nothing
but
good
at
pinon



not
only
embellishing
the
chateau
and
the
park

but
giving
much
time
and


money
to
improve
the
condition
of
the
people

he
would
probably
have


been
sent
to
the
guillotine
at
paris
by
the
local

directory
at
chauny



had
he
lived
long
enough

and
his
property
confiscated

like
the


property
of
the
bishops
and
dukes
at
anizy

his
oldest
son
was
a
lad
of


fifteen
when
the
storm
burst
in


his
mother
took
his
interests


resolutely
in
hand

she
came
of
two
aristocratic
stocks

the
millys
and


the
clermonts
tonnerre

but
she
got
the
better
of
the
democrats

like


old
madame
dupin
at
chenonceaux

she
carried
herself
and
her
property



by
woman
s
wit
and
woman
s
will

through
the
revolution

in

she


contrived
to
get
her
son

then
only
seventeen

elected
commander
of
the


national
guard
at
anizy

he
ripened
rapidly

under
the
stress
of
the


times

bought
up
the

patriots

when
it
was
necessary

and
there
is


abundant
evidence
to
show
that
they
were
always
in
the
market

even
at


paris
and
during
the
worst
times
of
the
terror

was
made
a
baron
of
the


empire
by
napoleon

elected
president
of
the
canton
of
anizy
in


a


councillor
general
of
the
aisne
in
the
same
year

and
deputy
in




with
the
restoration
he
became
once
more
vicomte
de
courval
and
seigneur


of
pinon

having
long
before
converted
the
park
and
gardens
of
the


chateau
into
the

english
style


with
fine
watercourses
and
an


extensive
lake

and
died
quietly
at
paris
in


in


at
the
age


of
twenty

he
married
a
daughter
of
the
marquis
de
saint
mars






his
son
and
successor

ernest
alexis
dubois
de
courval

was
taken


into
high
favour
by
charles
x


but
was
nevertheless
made
a


councillor
general
of
the
aisne
under
louis
philippe

he
married
the


only
daughter
of
moreau

who
was
a
child
of
nine
years
old
when
her


father
fell
fighting
against
france
and
napoleon
in


in
a
curious


gothic
tower
which
he
built
at
pinon
are
still
preserved
some
of
the


standards
captured
from
the
enemies
of
france
by
moreau

and
these
i
am


assured
are
the
only
such
standards

excepting
those
of
the
invalides



recovered
through
the
efforts
of
the
house
of
peers

which
existed
in


france
before
the
crimean
war

in
this
tower
the
vicomte
de
courval


formed
a
remarkable
collection
of
mediaeval
arms
and
armour

antique


furniture

stained
glass

medals
and
coins

this
region
is
very
rich
not


only
in
roman
remains

but
in
druidical
stones
and
other
vestiges
of
the


races
which
dwelt
here
before
caesar
came

marcus
aurelius

trajan



hadrian

alexander
severus

probus

gordian

constantine
and
constantius


are
all
represented
on
the
coins
found
in
and
around
the
property
of
m



de
courval

but
one
of
his
most
interesting
acquisitions
was
a
silver


coin
bearing
the
name
of
clovis

with
the
title
of

imperator


there
is


a
record
at
anizy
of
a
treasure
of
coins
of
aurelius

found
there
so


long
ago
as
in
the
middle
of
the
twelfth
century

and
under
the


bishop
dukes
of
laon
a
collection
of
roman
coins
and
vases
was
gradually


formed
at
the
mairie
of
anizy

which

disappeared

soon
after
the



patriots

of
chauny
undertook
to

liberate

that
commune






the
american
vicomtesse
de
courval

who
now
owns
pinon

and
passes
a


part
of
each
year
there

is
the
widow
of
a
son
of
this
ernest
de


courval






looking
backward
dispassionately
over
this

centennial
record

of
two


considerable
estates
in
the
department
of
the
aisne

what
advantages



social

political

or
economical

can
be
shown
to
have
enured
to
the


people
of
the
commune
of
anizy
and
of
pinon
from
the
revolutionary


processes
to
which
those
estates
were
subjected
a
hundred
years
ago

not


a
man
in
anizy
or
in
pinon
owns
a
rood
of
land
now
which
he
might
not


just
as
easily
have
owned
had
the
alienation
of
the
church
property
in


those
communes
been
conducted
through
the
gradual
and
systematic


processes
of
law
and
order

instead
of
one
remarkable
and
interesting


chateau

these
communes
would
now
possess
two

each
in
the
natural


course
of
things

a
centre
of
local
activity
and
civilisation

instead


of
one
ancient
church

much
despoiled
and
damaged

anizy
would
now


possess
three
such
churches

each
in
its
own
way
an
object
of
interest


to
architects
and
artists

and
it
would
be
possible
for
an
honest


gendarme
or
a
poor
labourer
on
the
highway
to
hear
mass

if
he
liked

in


any
one
of
them

without
incurring
the
wrath
of
his
superiors
and
the


loss
of
his
daily
bread















chapter

in

aisne


continued











laon





the
lofty
hill
on
which
the
sires
de
coucy
planted
their
chief
fortress


rises
above
the
fields
and
forests
of
the
soissonnais
as
the
mont


st

michel
rises
above
the
waves
and
the
sands
of
the
norman
coast






the
narrow
streets
and
quaint
old
houses
of
the
little
town
of


coucy
le
chateau
are
huddled
around
the
outworks
of
the
colossal
castle



almost
as
closely
as
are
the
climbing
streets
and
the
terraced
houses
of


st

michel
around
the
martial
monastery

and
each
of
these
two
places


is

in
its
own
kind

unique






i
had
been
strongly
recommended
to
pass
the
night
when
i
visited
the


chateau

not
in
the
little
city
itself

though
it
boasts
a

hotel
des


ruines


but
at
a
little
wayside
inn

rather
indeed
a
restaurant
and
a


baiting
place
for
travellers
by
the
highway
than
an
inn

which
stands
at


the
foot
of
the
hill
of
coucy

i
took
the
advice

and
had
no
cause
to


repent
it

the
walk
up
the
hill

of
some
two
miles

to
the
tower
and
the


castle
was
simply
delightful
on
a
fine
afternoon
in
june

opposite
my


little
inn
is
a
small
and
rather
dilapidated
chateau
of
the
eighteenth


century

which
originally
must
have
been
a
very
pleasant
residence

and


in
the
extensive
meadows
about
it
were
grazing
a
number
of
fine
cattle



the
property
of
m

de
vaublanche


he
is
the
only
man
hereabouts
who


takes
any
trouble
with
his
beasts


said
my
cheery

athletic
young


host

and
leading
the
way
for
me
into
the
meadows

he
pointed
out
the


princes
of
the
herd

all
of
them
really
fine
animals
of
the
best
french


breeds

with
as
much
pride
as
if
he
had
been
the
owner


it
gives
more


pleasure
to
see
these

does
it
not

sir


than
to
look
at
yonder
dead


chimney


he
said

pointing
to
some
extensive
sugarworks

all
closed
and


deserted

on
the
other
side
of
the
road

the
sugar
crisis
has
been
very


sharp
here

as
in
other
parts
of
france

and
many
smokeless
chimneys
are


to
be
seen
here
as
in
other
departments






an
embattled
gateway
of
the
thirteenth
century
welcomes
the
traveller


now
with
its
open
arch
as
he
approaches
the
town
of
coucy

and
the
best


views
of
the
chateau
are
to
be
got
from
the
road
as
you
climb
up
the


long
ascent






in
the
quaint
little
town
the
house
is
still
carefully
preserved

and


the
chamber
itself
religiously
kept
in
order

in
which

on
june






gabrielle
d
estrees
gave
birth
to
a
son
destined
afterwards
to
make
his


mark
in
the
military
annals
of
france
as
cesar

duc
de
vendome

an


inscription
on
a
tablet
in
the
wall
thus
commemorates
his
advent
into


the
world


in
this
chamber
was
born

and
in
the
chamber
above
was


baptized

the
legitimised
son
of
france

de
vendome

a
prince
of
very


good
hopes

the
child
of
the
most
christian

most
magnanimous

most


invincible

and
most
clement
king
of
france
and
of
navarre

henry
iv




and
of
gabrielle
d
estrees

duchesse
de
beaufort







not
far
from
this
house
is
the
ancient
belfry
of
coucy

wherein
swings
a


bell
of
dolorous
prestige

the
tradition
of
coucy
averring
that



whenever
a
citizen
of
coucy
is
about
to
die

this
bell
tolls
of
itself



and
is
heard
by
him
alone






doubtless
the
communal
schoolmaster
will
ere
long
drive
this
tradition


out
of
the
mind
of
the
rising
generation
in
coucy

if
so
i
trust

though


i
hardly
expect

that
he
will
drive
out
with
it
another
and
more


mischievous
tradition

born
within
the
precincts
of
the
ancient
castle



not
once

but
a
dozen
times

this
year
in
different
parts
of
france

i


have
seen
allusions
made

in
political
journals

to
the
monstrous
right


which
the
seigneurs
of
old
possessed
and
exercised
of
hanging
small
boys


for
snaring
and
killing
rabbits
within
their
parks
and
woods

the
old


game
laws
of
france

like
the
old
game
laws

and
indeed
like
many
other


old
laws

of
england
and
of
other
countries

were
not
over
mild

was
not


a
woman
first
strangled
and
then
burned
in
england
for

coining

in
the


year


while
the
states
general
were
performing
at
paris
their


fantastic
overture
to
the
ghastly
drama
of
the
terror

yet
england
in



knew
a
great
deal
more
of
personal
liberty
than
france
knows
now
in




the
tradition
of
the
seignorial
right
of
hanging
boys
for
killing


rabbits
originated

it
is
probable

with
enguerrand
iv


sire
de
coucy



of
whom
it
is
told
that

exasperated
by
three
young
lads

scholars
of


the
monastic
school
of
saint
nicolas
aux
bois

whom
he
found
shooting
at


rabbits
and
hares
in
his
woods
with
bows
and
arrows

he
had
the
lads


seized
and
hanged

so
far
from
doing
this
within
his
seignorial
rights



however

was
the
sire
de
coucy

that
the
monks
proceeded
against
him


vigorously

and
saint
louis
had
him
arrested
for
it

and
was
with
much


difficulty
restrained
by
the
barons
of
the
realm
from
hanging
him
in
his


turn

he
was
only
pardoned
on
very
severe
conditions

one
of
which
was


that
he
should
do
penance
for
a
number
of
years
in
his
own
castle
of


coucy

where

the
chroniclers
tell
us

he
died

in
shame
and


repentance


his
successor

enguerrand
v


took
the
matter
so
much
to


heart
that
he
led
the
life
of
an
anchorite
at
coucy

and
had
himself


buried
in
the
abbey
of
premontre
near
the
doorway

like
alonzo
de
ojeda


the
conquistador

the
slab
upon
whose
grave
i
saw
some
years
ago
at
the


entrance
of
the
ruined
church
of
san
francisco
in
santo
domingo

with
an


inscription
reciting
that
he
was
there
laid
to
rest

by
his
own
request



as
a
great
sinner

upon
whose
ashes
all
who
passed
should
tread






tortuous
little
streets
lead
through
the
town
of
coucy
into
a
great


green
space
which
commands
the
castle

it
is
approached
from
the
new
and


rather
pretentious
lodge
in
which
the
keeper
of
the
castle
now
resides



through
one
of
the
finest
and
loftiest
avenues
in
france

but
the


tallest
trees
are
dwarfed
by
the
gigantic
donjon
tower

this
rises
to
a


height
still
of
at
least

feet

it
is

feet
in
circumference
at


the
base

and
slopes
very
gradually
to
the
summit

the
hall
on
the


ground
floor
measures
more
than
forty
feet
in
diameter

the
walls
being


of
enormous
thickness

over
one
of
the
doorways
is
a
defaced
bas
relief


representing
a
lion
attacked
and
slain
by
enguerrand
i

de
coucy

the


chimney
place
in
the
ground
floor
hall
would
make
a
very
respectable


modern
house

and
there
is
a
well
within
the
hall
said
to
be
of
unknown


depth

the
donjon
consists
of
three
storeys
above
the
ground
floor

the


main
hall
on
the
first
floor
being
particularly
remarkable
for
its


height

the
vaulted
ceiling
of
this
hall
must
have
been
very
fine

and


throughout
it
is
apparent
that
the
builders
of
the
chateau
de
coucy
had


the
comfort
of
the
inmates
and
a
certain
stately
elegance
of
effect
much


more
in
mind
than
was
common
with
the
builders
of
castles
in
the


thirteenth
century

the
walls
at
the
summit
are
more
than
nine
feet


thick

and
they
were
doubtless
surmounted
originally
with
a
great


circular
gallery
of
wood
covered
in
with
a
roof

the
sires
de
coucy



like
other
crusaders

doubtless
brought
back
all
manner
of
rich
carpets


and
stuffs
from
the
east

and
with
these
and
the
wonderful
carved
chests


and
massive
woodwork
of
the
time
the
chateau
de
coucy
may
well
have
been


a
much
more
agreeable
place
of
abode
than

from
our
modern
acquaintance


with
their
winding
stone
stairways
and
denuded
walls

we
are
apt
to


imagine
these
great
feudal
fortresses
to
have
been






the
views
from
the
summit
now
are
simply
superb

the
vast
forests
over


which
enguerrand

the
builder

gazed

seeking
out
the
sites
on
which
he


planted
so
many
strongholds


it
is
known
that
besides
coucy
he
erected


at
least
eight
other
castles

from
folembray
to
saint
lambert


have


been
replaced
in
great
part
by
fertile
fields
and
smiling
towns

but
the


land
is
still
richly
wooded

far
down

in
a
little
wilderness
beneath


us

the
guardian
pointed
out
to
me
an
odd
edifice
looking
like
a


combination
of
a
modern
gothic
church
with
a
seaside
villa

this

he


told
me

was
the
residence
of
a
distinguished
artist
of
paris

who


passes
a
part
of
every
year
in
this
region

making
studies
of
forest


scenery

beyond
this

in
a
large
park

is
a
chateau
of
the
marquis
de
la


chataigneraie

once
a
part
of
the
domain
of
coucy






the
enceinte
of
the
chateau
is
of
enormous
extent

the
solidity
of
the


walls
and
the
towers
resisted
so
successfully
the
mines
and
pickaxes
of


richelieu
that
the
great
outlines
of
the
immense
building
are
still


easily
definable

with
fine
traces
of
the
architecture
of
the
great


chapel

that
st

louis
and
henry
iv

visited
coucy
we
know

and
the


guardian
was
good
enough
to
give
me
very
minute
and
particular


information
as
to
the
chambers
which
they
occupied






he
was
a
curious
fellow

this
guardian

an
alsatian
immigrant

he


informed
me

the
people
here

he
thought

were
not
so
much
pleased
as


they
ought
to
be
that
the
government
had
given
him
the
place

which


brings
him
in

francs
a
year

with
the
lodge
i
have
mentioned
for
a


residence

and
the
right
to
all
the
crops
of
any
kind
he
can
raise
on


the
land
attached
to
the
chateau

he
was
then
cutting
the
grass

which


grew
very
well
within
the
precincts
of
the
chateau

but
he
took
great


pains
to
impress
upon
me
that
he
was
doing
this

not
so
much
for
the


sake
of
the
hay
he
expected
to
make
as
for
the
accommodation
of
visitors


like
myself


to
make
the
ground
pleasanter
to
walk
upon







this
was
an
attention
which
no
right
minded
person
could
fail
to


recognise
with
a

pour
boire


particularly
as
the
worthy
guardian


complained
of
the
extremely
poor
quality
of
the
wine
grown
about
coucy



i
told
him
i
had
always
heard
that
king
francis
i

insisted
on
having


his
wine
sent
to
him
from
this
place


ah


he
replied


in
those
days


what
did
they
know
about
good
wine







the
rooks
in
countless
numbers
were
flying
and
cawing
all
over
the


beautiful
old
place


i
have
tried
to
kill
these
birds


said
the


guardian
wearily


they
destroy
my
peas

but
the
cartridges
cost
too


much

and
i
have
had
to
give
it
up


he
had
been
in
his
place
four


months

i
might
think
it
very
pleasant
seeing
it
in
june

but
if
i
could


see
it
in
february

with
the
wind
howling

through
the
tall
trees
and


around
the
huge
tower







on
my
return
to
my
neat
little
hostelry
my
host
came
out
to
meet
me


he


had
just
heard
that
four
councillors
general

on
their
way
home
from
a


meeting

would
like
to
dine
at
his
house

would
i
object
to
their
dining


with
me

there
was
no
other
good
room


naturally
i
was
only
too
glad
to


share
the
room
and
the
dinner
with
them

a
very
good
dinner
it
was
too




men
learn
to
cook

but
are
born
to
roast


my
host
s
cook
was
born
to


roast
both
fat
chickens
and
a
capital
leg
of
mutton

one
of
the


councillors
general

when
they
drove
up

went
out
into
the
kitchen
to


examine
and
report
upon
the
outlook

he
came
back
presently
rubbing
his


hands
together
with
glee


admirable


he
exclaimed


it
will
be
a


belshazzar
s
feast

a
superb
leg
of
mutton

truly
superb








the
first
green
peas
of
the
season
here


said
our
host

coming
in
with


them


you
will
see
if
they
are
good

they
come
late
here

the
green


peas

but
you
see
what
they
are
when
they
do
come







the
four
councillors
general
were
all
republicans

one
of
them

a


country
banker

as
i
learned

was
a
trifle
sarcastic
about
the
prospects


of
the
party


they
are
too
soft


he
said


at
paris

they
lack
wrist



they
do
not
hit
hard
enough

what
we
want
is
a
man

where
are
we
to
find


him


another

a
tall
grey
bearded
man

an
attorney

agreed
with
the


banker
as
to
the

softness

of
the
authorities


i
am
a
republican
of


yesterday


he
said


i
remember

under
the
empire

how

when
i
spoke
at


chauny

i
spoke
with
a
gendarme
at
the
table
behind
me

and
a
couple
of


spies
in
the
hall

that
is
what
we
should
have
now
in
these
meetings


where
they
abuse
the
republic


i
observed
that
while
this
councillor



by
the
way

always
spoke
of

the
republic


the
banker
as
invariably


spoke
of

the
republican
party


they
both
agreed

however

and
their


companions
agreed
with
them

that
the
real
want
was
the

want
of
a
man








the
president
is
doing
well
though


said
the
grey
bearded

republican


of
yesterday



he
is
beginning
to
stand
out
against
the
horizon

is
he


not


the
others
were
not
so
sure
of
this

and
then
there
arose
a
most


lively
and
singularly
outspoken
exchange
of
views
as
to
the
different


leaders
of
the
republican
party

it
would
be
hardly
fair
for
me
to
cite


these

but
one
remark
made
by
the
banker

in
regard
to
a
very


conspicuous
political
personage

amused
me


yes


he
said
in
reply
to


one
of
his
companions


yes






is
skilful

very
skilful

but
he
has
no


foresight

would
you
trust
him
with
your
pocket
book

no



oh
certainly


not







it
seemed
they
had
been
attending
a
conference
about
agriculture

they


were
all
agreed
as
to
the
existence
of

an
agricultural
crisis


but


beyond
that
they
seemed
to
be
at
sea

one
councillor
was
quite
sure
that


the
thing
to
be
done
was
to
get
the
farmers
to
use
cattle
instead
of


horses
in
their
work

the
cattle
cost
less

worked
as
well

and
they


could
be
killed
for
beef

they
were
also
more
valuable
as
fertilisers



upon
this
another
councillor

apparently
the
only
agriculturist
of
the


company

went
into
a
disquisition
on
chemical
fertilisers
and
the


scientific
applications
of
them







i
never
believed
in
these
chemicals


he
said


till
last
year

but


last
year
i
was
in
my
fields

talking
with
my
neighbour
so
and
so

who


has
spent
i
know
not
how
much
on
these
chemicals

he
went
away
with
his


men
after
a
while

and
i
saw
they
had
been
applying
their
chemicals
to
a


field
sown
like
mine

an
idea
occurred
to
me

i
went
and
brought
a


basket

i
stepped
across
into
their
field
and
took
a
certain
quantity
of


their
chemicals

these
i
applied
in
a
particular
part
of
my
field

do


you
know
the
plants
came
up
there
wonderfully

but
really
quite


wonderfully

there
is
no
doubt
there
is
a
good
deal
in
these
chemicals



but
one
should
test
them
first







after
dinner
we
sate
out
in
front
of
the
little
inn
for
a
time
with
our


coffee

there
was
a
good
deal
of
coming
and
going

a
tremendous


clattering
about
of
children
in
little
wooden

sabots


and
much


good
natured

chaff

between
the
people
of
the
inn

who
came
out
to


take
the
air
after
their
day
s
work

and
the
passers
by

there
seems
to


be
little
in
the
peasants
here
of
that
positive

morgue


not
to
say


arrogance

which
marks
the
demeanour
of
their
class
in
the
western
parts


of
france

there
are
regions
in
brittany
where
the
carriage
of
the


peasants
towards
the

bourgeois

gives
reality
and
zest
to
the
old
story


of
the

ci
devant

noble
who
called
a
particularly
insolent
varlet
to


order
in
the
days
of
the
first
revolution
by
saying
to
him


nay



friend

you
will
be
good
enough
to
remember
that
we
are
living
in
a


republic

and
that
i
am
your
equal







there
was
the
most
perfect
civility
and
amiableness
even
in
the


interchange
of
not
very
delicate
pleasantries
between
the
people
at


coucy


don
t
go
too
near
the
butcher
s
shop


called
out
one
of
the


ostlers
to
a
man
with
whom
he
had
been
talking
as
the
latter
drove
off


in
his
cart


ah

you
won
t
eat
me

if
i
do


the
other
replied


it


would
cost
you
too
much


an
old
farmer
who
sate
sipping
his

petit


verre

near
me

explained
to
me
that
the
man
was
a
resident
of
barisis



a
little
village
not
very
far
off

the
dwellers
in
which
from
time


immemorial
have
been
known
as

the
pigs
of
barisis



try
and
pick
up
a


husband
on
the
way


another
of
the
stable
lads
called
out
after
a


pretty
girl
who
paused
with
a
companion

as
she
went
by
the
place

to


chat
with
him


try
and
pick
up
a
husband
on
the
way
and
we
ll
keep
the


wedding
feast
here



ah
bah


the
damsel
rejoined
in
a
merry
voice




more
marryers
come
your
way
than
ours

tie
up
the
first
one
that
comes


and
keep
him
for
me


this
quickness
to
catch
and
return
the
ball


certainly
shows
a
greater
natural
or
acquired
alertness
of
mind
among


these
picard
peasants
than
is
commonly
found
in
people
of
the
same


condition
in
rural
england






the
country
all
the
way
from
coucy
to
laon
is
one
continuous
garden

and


laon
itself
is
pre
eminently
a
city
set
on
a
hill

the
chateau
de
coucy


stands
upon
its
pinnacle
of
rock

like
a
knight
in
armour

with
folded


arms

looking
loftily
down
upon
the
world

conscious
of
his
strength



and
calmly
awaiting
attack

the
fortress
city
of
laon

a
fortress
from


the
earliest
roman
days

looks
out
from
the
promontory
on
which
it


stands

over
the
wide
expanse
of
plain
beyond
and
around
it

like
an


advanced
sentinel

watchful
and
alert






you
go
up
to
it
by
long
flights
of
steps

as
in
the
case
of
so
many


high
perched
italian
towns

and
the
fine
winding
carriage
way
which
has


been
constructed
around
the
hill

commands

from
beneath
the
beautiful


trees
by
which
it
is
shaded

a
series
of
the
finest
imaginable
views

it


has
suffered
much

of
course

from
war

and
not
a
little
from
the


revolutionists

but
its
magnificent
cathedral
and
the
ancient
palace
of


the
bishop
dukes

now
occupied
by
the
courts
of
justice

have
fared


better
than
many
other
monuments

for
some
time
past

however

the


cathedral
has
been
undergoing
repairs

which
is
as
much
as
to
say
that


the
interior
is
practically
hidden
from
the
eye
by
a
maze
of
scaffolds


and
hoardings
and
ladders

mr

ruskin
somewhere
complains

not
wholly


without
reason

that

the
french
are
always
doing
something
to
their


cathedrals


and
the
complaint
is
in
order
now
both
as
to
laon
and
as
to


nantes

no
one
can
tell
when
the
fine
recumbent
statue
of
raoul
de


coucy

who
fell
at
mansourah
by
the
side
of
st

louis

will
again
be


visible
at
laon

or
the
matchless
tomb
of
the
duchesse
anne
at
nantes






here

as
in
the
region
around
chauny
and
coucy

i
was
struck
with
the


extreme
good
nature
and
simplicity
of
the
people

through
the
narrow



old
fashioned
streets
went
the
town
crier
with
his
bell

calling



attention

attention

attention


announcing
an
auction
sale
of


furniture
after
the
old
custom
which
existed
in
some
old
american
towns


quite
down
to
the
middle
of
the
present
century






the
people
were
at
their
trades
in
the
street

as
in
the
italian
towns



shoemakers
hammering
at
their
lasts

ironworkers
banging
and
thumping


away

when
i
had
found
the
house
of
a
gentleman
whom
i
wished
to
see

in


the
beautiful
old
cathedral
close

and
had
rung
in
vain
a
dozen
times
at


the
bell

a
courteous
passer
by
paused

and
asked
me
if
i
wished
to
find


m







eh


he
said


the
house
is
shut
up
because
he
is
in
the


country
for
the
day

i
think
he
will
be
here
to
morrow

but
if
you
will


come
with
me
i
will
show
you
a
little
inn
not
far
from
here
where
i
know


you
will
find
his
coachman

who
can
tell
you
exactly
when
he
will


return







how
long
would
a
stranger
have
to
ring
at
the
door
of
a
house
in
an


english
cathedral
town
before
it
would
occur
to
anybody
passing
to
stop


and
thus
enlighten
him






with
all
their
kindness
and
good
nature

however

the
people
of
laon
are


not
lukewarm
in
politics

i
found
a
hairdresser

the
local
figaro

a


raging
boulangist


he
had
served
in
tonkin

he
had
seen

with
his
own


eyes
seen
the
soldiers
robbed
and
starved
and
left
to
die

he
had
seen



with
his
own
eyes
seen
the
government
people
taking
huge

wine
pots



from
the
natives

it
was

infecte


and
the
governor
richaud

whom
they


called
back
to
france
because
he
wished
to
expose
the
way
in
which
his


predecessor
had
taken
thousands
of
francs
and
a
diamond
belt
from
the


king
of
cambodia

norodom

i
had
surely
heard
of
that







i
certainly
had
heard
of
that

for
all
france
rang
with
the
exposure


made
of
it
in
the
chamber
of
deputies

that
is
to
say

all
france
rang


with
it
for
a
couple
of
days







yes

that
is
true

paris
forgets
everything
in
a
day

and
monsieur
is


speaking
of
paris

but
here
in
laon
we
do
not
forget

monsieur
will
see



was
it
natural

i
ask

monsieur

that
of
all
the
people
on
board
of
the


ship
which
was
bringing
back
m

richaud
to
france

he

only
he

and
his


valet

his
chinese
valet

i
ask
was
it
natural
only
they
two
should
on


the
ocean
have
the
cholera

and
die

was
it
natural

and
if
they
died


was
that
a
reason
why
all
the
effects

all
the
papers

note
that



monsieur

all
the
papers
of
m

richaud

the
papers
to
prove
that


corruption
exists
there
in
tonkin

should
be
thrown
overboard

all


thrown
into
the
sea

yes

and
on
what
pretext

to
save
the
rest
of
the


ship
from
the
cholera

is
it
transparent

that

no

we
must
have


boulanger








the
light
must
be
let
in

we
must
have
the
light








were
there
many
people
of
figaro
s
mind
in
laon
and
in
the
department








if
there
are
many

you
will
see

monsieur

here
in
the
aisne
we
shall


elect
the
greatest
friend
of
general
boulanger

monsieur
does
not
know


him

m

castelin

andre
castelin

ah

he
is
strong

castelin

he
was
in


africa
with
general
boulanger

he
was
there
with
the
general
when
he
put


his
hand
on
that
governor
of
tunis

that
cambon

the
brother

monsieur


knows

of
that
cambon
who
was
a
deputy

castelin
saw
the
general
at
work


in
tunis

he
is
with
him

he
will
be
with
him
in
the
new
chamber

we


shall
elect
castelin

and
then

you
will
see







my
notes
of
figaro
s
very
clear
and
positive
talk
in
the
summer
are
not


without
interest
to
me
now
when
i
revise
them
in
the
autumn

for
figaro


prophesied
truly

and
the
department
of
the
aisne
certainly
did
elect


m

andre
castelin
to
be
one
of
its
deputies
at
paris






another
worthy
citizen
of
laon
with
whom
i
talked
in
his
shop

a


shoemaker

while
much
less
confident
than
figaro
as
to
the
results
of


the
elections

was
quite
as
positive
in
his
hostility
to
the
government



it
is
the
tendency
of
shoemakers
all
over
the
world

within
my


observations

to
be
extreme
radicals

the
shoemakers
of
lynn
in


massachusetts
long
ago
were
the
advanced
guard

i
remember

of
the


abolitionists

they
were
the
strength
of
the

old
org




the

old


organisation


enemies
of
slavery

as
slavery

without
compromise
or


hesitation

every
man
of
them
was
as
ready
as
the
simple
cobbler
of


agawam
to
tackle
any
problem

terrestrial
or
celestial

at
a
moment
s


notice

it
was
idle
to
cite

ne
sutor

to
them
in
matters
of
art
or
of


politics

of
science
or
of
theology

my
shoemaker
of
laon
was
less
of
a


fanatic

but
not
less
of
a
philosopher

than
his
brethren
of
lynn

he


was
opposed
to
the
republic

but
he
was
equally
opposed
to
the
monarchy



he
had
his
idea

it
was
that
government
must
be
abolished

and
the


affairs
of
the
country
carried
on
by
committees
of
experts

he
liked
the


law
authorising
professional
syndicates

there
he
thought
was
the
germ


of
the
true
system

the
professional
syndicates
should
nominate
the


experts

each
syndicate
the
experts
in
its
own
business

these
should


meet

settle
the
general
necessary
budget

recommend
measures

then
the


people

in
their
communes

should
act
upon
all
this

it
was
his
system



it
would
be
long
to
develop

he
was
not
a
man
to
write
or
to
speak

but


he
thought






as
to
the
present
situation
he
bitterly
condemned
the
exposition

it
was


a
mistake

for
it
brought
all
the
world
to
see
the
progress
of
france


and
to
steal
the
french
ideas

it
also
took
too
many
people
to
paris



that
was
good
for
the
railways

but
proudhon
long
ago
was
right

the


railways
were
the
new
feudal
system

they
were
the
enemy
more
than


clericalism

then
see
to
what
corruption
this
exposition
led

had
i
not


seen
the
votes

the
credits
given
to
the
ministers
for
entertaining




ah

it
was
monstrous


with
this
he
drew
a
paper
out
of
his
pocket

he


had
it
all
there

with
the
dates
and
the
figures


observe

monsieur



here

on
april


the
chamber
votes
one
million
of
francs

yes

one


million
of
francs
to
be
allowed
for
dinners

for
balls

for
punches

for


i
know
not
what

to
the
ministers

only
to
the
ministers

how
many
are


they

ten

yes

one
hundred
thousand
francs
to
each
of
them
for
eating


and
drinking
during
the
famous
exposition

only
there
are
some
who
get


more

some
who
get
less

that
little
watchmaker
tirard

they
give
him




francs

did
he
ever
earn


francs
in
his
life

never

and


will
they
spend
all
this
money
on
dinners
and
punches

no

never
in


life

it
is
just
simply
to
pocket
a
million
of
the
money
of
the
people







that
the
political
contest
will
be
sharp
in
laon
i
am
assured
by
a


friend
who
is
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
whole
machinery
of
politics


in
this
department
of
the
aisne

laon

it
seems

is
the
true


headquarters
of
the
freemasonry
of
this
department

and
in
the
aisne

to


use
his
language


the
freemasons
are
the
government



i
mean
this


he


said


in
a
more
extensive
sense
than
you
may

perhaps

be
disposed
to


accept

you
will
find

i
think

if
the
government
secures
a
majority
in


the
next
chamber

that
the
aisne
will
have
a
good
deal
to
say
in
the


organisation
of
the
chamber

then

perhaps

you
will
understand
the
true


meaning
of
that
letter
of
m

allain
targe

of
which
you
heard
at
chauny



there
is
a
pretty
comedy
under
it

for
m

allain
targe

remember

is
a


freemason







it
would
be
very
amusing

but
we
taxpayers
have
to
pay
too
much
for
the


play

what
you
were
told
at
chauny
about
the
freemasons
in
the


department
was
quite
true

only
you
did
not
get
the
whole
of
the
truth



look
at
the
press
of
the
department

you
saw
at
chauny
the
building
of


the
local
journal
there


la
defense
nationale








certainly
i
had
seen
it

for
it
is
the
most
conspicuous
and
the
newest


edifice
in
the
main
street
of
chauny

and
so
glorious
with
golden


letters
that
i
took
it
for
a
great
insurance
office







very
well

that
journal
is
under
the
control
of
a
brother
of
the
order



a
hatter
at
chauny

m

bugnicourt

here

at
laon

the

tribune


the


chief
republican
organ
of
the
department

is
entirely
in
the
hands
of


the
order

the
chairman
of
the
publishing
company
is
brother
dupuy

go


on
towards
hirson
by
the
railway
and
you
will
come
to
the
busy
little


town
of
vervins

brother
dupuy
sits
in
the
chamber
of
deputies
for


vervins

and
at
vervins
brother
dupuy
owns
and
prints
another
journal




le
liberal
de
vervins


the
political
director
of
the

tribune

here
at


laon
is
brother
doumer

brother
doumer

as
you
know

is
also
a
deputy



and
how
did
he
become
a
deputy

let
me
tell
you

it
is
an
instructive


story

and
you
will
find
m

allain
targe
at
work
in
it

that
excellent


man
who
will
not
make
promises
to
the
electors
which
he
cannot
keep








in
the
winter
of


m

ringuier

a
deputy
from
the
second


circumscription
of
laon

unexpectedly
died

the
order
at
once
determined


to
capture
his
seat

with
brother
allain
targe
as
prefect

what
could
be


easier

m

allain
targe
hastened
the
new
election
almost
indecently



hardly
a
fortnight
after
the
death
of
m

ringuier

early
in
march




the
brethren
came
up
from
all
quarters
to
laon

and
it
was
announced


that
brother
doumer
had
received
the
orthodox
republican
nomination

of


course

with
the
prefecture
and
the
freemason
press
of
laon

chauny



soissons

chateau
thierry

vervins

behind
him

doumer
was
elected

this


year
he
will
find
it
harder
work

for
all
the
opposition
will
be


concentrated
in
support
of
castelin

the
friend
of
boulanger

brother


allain
targe
is
no
longer
prefect

but
his
secretary

another
brother



huc

no
kinsman
of
the
famous
abbe


is
sub
prefect
at
soissons

and
the


brethren
all
over
the
department
help
each
other
in
every


circumscription

they
are
very
strong
among
the
revenue
officers

and


that

as
you
will
easily
understand

gives
them
and
the
order
generally


a
very
important
invisible
leverage

i
could
tell
you
now
of
a
brother


at
soissons
whom
they
mean
to
put
into
the
chamber

they
knew
his
money


value

they
have
got
him
into
their
shop

he
is
as
stupid
as
he
is


rich

just
as
fit
to
be
a
deputy
as
to
command
the
garrison
of
paris



but
they
will
get
him
nominated

and
then
the
government
will
get
him


elected

and
then
he
will
do
the
bidding
of
brother
doumer
and
the


others

to
help
them
to
put
pressure
on
the
ministers
and
on
the


president

and
be
helped
by
them
to
recoup
himself

in
one
way
or


another

for
all
the
cash
advances
he
will
make
before
he
is
elected







laon
sends
two
deputies
to
the
chamber

my
friend
s
opinion
in
august


was
that
the
opposition
now
control
the
city

and
that
both
of
these


seats
would
be
carried
against
the
government

the
event
proved
that
he


was
right

he
was
right

too

as
to
the
outlook
at
chateau
thierry

the


charming
birthplace
of
la
fontaine

on
the
road
to
epernay

there
he


expected
to
see
the
republican
candidate
who
sat
in
the
late
chamber

m



lesguillier

hold
his
seat
against
the
monarchical
candidate

m

de


mandat
grancey

the
author
of
a
well
known
and
interesting
book
on


ireland


chez
paddy


m

de
mandat
grancey
is
a
landed
proprietor
who


has
taken
an
active
and
successful
part
in
promoting
the
improvement
of


the
breed
of
horses
in
this
country

he
is
a
man
of
liberal
ideas
as


well
as
a
man
of
enterprise

and
in
the
present
agricultural

crisis




of
which
one
hears
so
much
in
france

such
men
would
certainly
be
of
use


in
the
chamber

but
at
chateau
thierry

according
to
my
friend




everything
is
organised
by
the
freemasons

they
control
a
journal


there

the

avenir
de
l
aisne


the
mayor

m

morlot

is
a
freemason



another
freemason

an
ex
deputy

m

deville

wields
great
influence


there

you
will
see
that
the
recent
deputy

who
is
an
insignificant


person

will
be
re
elected

and
that
m

de
mandat
grancey

who
would
be


of
use

will
be
beaten








perhaps
because
he
is
an
avowed
monarchist


i
replied


and
the
people


may
be
republicans







my
friend
looked
at
me
for
a
moment


are
you
speaking
seriously







of
course
i
was







well

then

that
astonishes
me

can
you
possibly
suppose

after
all
you


have
seen
and
known
of
france

that
the
people
in
a
place
like
chateau


thierry
are
such
simpletons
as
to
believe
that
it
makes
the
slightest


difference
what
name
you
give
to
a
government

they
leave
that
sort
of


thing
to
the
journalists
and
the
village
actors

they
have
long
memories


in
the
provinces

and
they
judge
governments

not
at
all
by
their
names



but
by
their
men

they
know
the
functionaries
by
heart


not
much
of
a


government


they
say
to
one
another


that
sends
us
so
and
so








in
this
region
the
empire
is
still
very
popular

thanks
mainly
to
this



no

outside
of
the
influence
of
the
freemasons

which
will
be
exerted


against
him
through
the
pressure
put
upon
the
friends
and
families
of


the
small
army
of
government
employes

and
will
therefore
be
formidable



what
m

de
mandat
grancey
will
have
most
to
fear
will
be
not
the


preference
of
the
people
for
the
republic

for
that

i
tell
you

does


not
exist

but
the
indiscreet
zeal
of
some
of
the
clergy
in
his
behalf







it
is
natural
the
clergy
should
wish
to
be
rid
of
this
persecuting
gang


at
paris

and
of
these
disgusting
freemasons

quite
natural

but
they
do


not
always
remember
one
peculiarity
of
our
peasants

there
is
a
great


love
for
the

culte

here
among
our
people

a
very
great
love
for
it



but
they
do
not
like
to
be
meddled
with
in
politics
by
the
cures
or
the


priests

they
will
vote
for
the
cure
if
the
cure
lets
them
alone

but
if


he
bothers
them
about
it
they
are
much
more
likely
to
vote
against
him







if
constans
knows
his
business
he
will
tell
that
freemason
thevenot



the
keeper
of
the
seals

to
let
the
cures
and
the
clergy
do
all
they


feel
disposed
to
do
in
politics

pardie

i
am
not
sure
he
has
not


already
been
suborning
some
of
our
cures
to
go
into
a
conservative


propaganda








this
is
my
great
fear


he
added
presently


for
soissons
in
september



we
ought
to
carry
that
seat

the
freemasons
mean
to
make
the
republicans


accept
a
most
absurd
candidate
there

as
i
have
told
you

and
if
we
can


only
keep
some
of
our
clerical
friends
quiet

we
shall
beat
him

but
we


shall
see

if
the
cures
hurt
us
sometimes
by
their
over
zeal

on
the


other
hand
the
republican
deputies
and
functionaries
help
us
by
making


the
republic
disreputable
in
the
eyes
of
serious
people

and
that
in
all


classes
of
society







look
at
the
working
men

for
example

here
in
laon

there
are
a
good


many
of
them
who
know
m

doumer
much
better
since
he
became
a
deputy


than
they
knew
him
when
he
was
first
a
candidate







the
question
of
the
societes
ouvrieres
is
a
question
which
means
a
good


deal
for
the
working
men

m

doumer
would
have
been
well
advised
had
he


let
it
alone

but
no

m

doumer
gets
himself
appointed
to
draw
up
a


report
of
the
chamber
of
deputies
on
this
question

with
a
project
of
a


law
to
supersede

modify

extend
the
law
of


under
which


co
operative
societies
have
so
far
grown
up
in
france







the
report
and
the
project

as
finally
edited
by
the
aspiring
deputy


for
laon

a
freemason
as
i
have
told
you

are
to
be
printed
by
another


freemason

the
worthy
hatter

m

bugnicourt

at
chauny

who
is
the
chief


personage
of
the

defense
nationale


and
all
the
voters
are
to
see
how


brother
doumer
devotes
himself
to
the
interests
of
the
working
classes



at
paris

while
other
deputies
go
about
amusing
themselves
with
the



danseuses
du
ventre


and
the
other
marvels
of
the
exposition







this
is
all
very
well







but
brother
doumer

in
his
desire
to
pose
before
the
voters
of
the


aisne
as
the
heaven
born
deputy
in
whom
the
working
man
may
put
his


trust

takes
the
trouble
to
make
it
quite
clear
that
the
republic
has


done
absolutely
nothing
but
appoint
committees
to
sit
upon

the
great


question

of
co
operation
among
the
working
classes







brother
doumer

as
i
have
told
you

was
made
a
deputy
in


after


taking
his
seat
he
was
made
a
member
of
the
committee
which
has
been


conducting
an

extra
parliamentary
enquiry

on
the
subject
of


co
operative
societies
among
working
men
for
work
and
for
production



and
with
the
question
of
contracts
between
employers
and
working
men


for
participation
in
the
profits
of
industrial
enterprises







this
committee

he
says
in
his
report

took
the
matter
in
hand
in




and
spent

five
years

over
it

getting
its
project
of
a
law
on
these


subjects
into
shape
only
in


on
the
eve
of
the
election
of
a
new


chamber
of
deputies







during
these
five
long
years

according
to
brother
doumer

the
republic


was
content
to
let
co
operation
among
working
men
take
its
chances
under


a
law
passed
in


under
the
second
empire

and
yet

according
still


to
brother
doumer

the
idea
of
co
operation
among
the
working
classes


was
an
exclusively
french
idea

and
not
only
an
exclusively
french
idea



but
an
idea
which
came
to
birth
only
under
the
republic
of


he


glides
silently
over
the
famous
experiment
of
the
national
workshops
of





is
it
not
really
remarkable
that
the
republicans
of

should


have
been
willing
to
leave
this

beautiful
and
generous

idea
at
the


mercy
of
a
law
passed
by
the
empire

and
which

still
according
to


brother
doumer

left
the
co
operative
societies
of
working
men
without


privileges

without
favour

and
with
no
particular
facilities
for


constituting
themselves
and
for
keeping
themselves
alive







i
say
the

republicans
of


advisedly

for
you
will
see

if
you


look
at
page

of
this
delightful
report

that

still
according
to


brother
doumer

we
really
had
no
republic

in
fact

in
france
till




these
are
his
own
words


the
republic

having
been
reconstituted




after
the
fall
of
the
empire


first
in
name


and
afterwards
in
fact



a
new
impulse
was
given
to
co
operation

the
ill
will
towards
all


societies
of
working
men
of
the
governments
of
may

and
of
may




retarded
the
movement

it
was
only
in

that

the
wounds
of
the


country
having
been
healed
and
liberty
reconquered

we
had
leisure
to


occupy
ourselves
with
the
question
of
the
organisation
of
labour








is
not
this
charming

really

when
one
remembers
what
the

wounds
of


the
country

were
in


and
how
those

wounds

were
got
first
through


the
collapse
of
the
wretched
government
of
the
national
defence

and


then
through
the
commune
of
paris

the
governments
of
may

and
may



may
be
credited
with
having
done
a
good
piece
of
work
by

healing
those


wounds

and
by

reconquering
liberty


is
not
this
plain







but
the

wounds
having
been
healed


and

liberty
having
been


reconquered


the
true
republic

still
according
to
brother
doumer

was


set
free
in


to
occupy
itself
with
the
question
of
the
organisation


of
labour

very
good









that
is
ten
years
ago

and
only
in

do
we
find
the
republic


really
occupying
itself

in
the
person
of
brother
doumer

with
this


great
question

this
beautiful
and
generous
idea

how
very
odd

and
what


a
strange
coincidence
that
brother
doumer

elected
a
deputy
by
the
grace


of
the
freemasons
in


and
wishing
to
be
re
elected
a
deputy
by


their
grace
in


should
be
the
man
of
destiny
called
upon
to
solve


this
great
question







he
makes
this
perfectly
plain







two
ministers
of
public
works

m

de
freycinet
and
m

sadi
carnot


he


blandly
observes


studied
measures
which
might
be
taken
in
view
of


facilitating
the
concession
to
societies
of
working
men
of
certain


public
works







ah

this
is
hard
upon
m

de
freycinet
and
m

sadi
carnot

now
president


of
the
ideal
republic

they

studied


did
they


measures
which
might


be
taken


but
they
never
took
any
such
measures

oh

no

not
they








so
the
first
year
of
the

true
republic

went
by

and
still


co
operation
languished
under
the
imperial
law
of


then
in



came
m

de
lacretelle

who

presented
to
the
chambers
a
proposed
law


tending

to
the
same
end
which
m

de
freycinet
and
m

sadi
carnot
had
so


unprofitably

studied


of
course
the
chamber
eagerly
adopted
it

not
at


all

it
was
never
discussed







two
years
thrown
away
by
the
true
republic







then
in

m

floquet

now
the
favourite
candidate
of
brother
doumer


for
the
presidency
of
the
chamber
if
the
republicans
carry
the
elections


of



being
made
prefect
of
the
seine

had
a
great
impulse


he


wished
to
revive
the
decree
of

as
to
that
department


excellent


man

but
he
did
not
in
fact
revive
it

he
did
what
he
could

he



appointed
a
committee
to
study
the
question


and
this
studious


committee
eventually
evolved

what


a
new
schedule
of
prices
for
the


public
works
of
the
city
of
paris

which
favoured
co
operative
societies


and
contractors
whose
workmen
were
to
participate
in
their
profits








so
the
fourth
year
of
the
true
republic
began

and
found
the

beautiful


and
generous
idea

still
prostrate
under
the
imperial
law
of








in


still
according
to
brother
doumer

two
deputies

m

ballue


backed
by
several
colleagues

and
m

laroche
joubert
heroically
rushed


before
the
chamber

each
with
a
proposed
law

tending


how
all
these


laws

tend



to
make
it
obligatory
upon
all
contractors
for
public


works
to
give
their
workmen
a
share
in
their
profits

but
the
chamber


paid
no
heed

and
the
fourth
year
of
the
true
republic
ended

leaving


the

beautiful
and
generous
idea

still
under
the
iron
heel
of
the


imperial
law
of








then
came
march




and
the
minister
of
the
interior
rose
at
last


to
the
height
of
his
mission

he
took
it
upon
himself
to
issue
a


decree

instituting
what

an
extra
parliamentary
committee
to

study



the
question
of
working
men
s
associations

and
if

and
how

they
should


be
admitted
to
take
part
in
the
public
works
of
the
state








bravo








and
the
committee
was
appointed

it
consisted


it
is
still
brother


doumer
who
speaks


of
directors
and
high
functionaries
of
all
the


ministerial
departments


it
went
to
work

it
heard

a
great
number
of


witnesses


it
also
showed
conclusively

how
complex
was
the
question




and
how
urgent
the
necessity
of
a
solution










what
then
happened








the
committee
immediately
went
to
sleep









after
an
interruption

of
more
than
a
year


it
is
still
brother


doumer
who
speaks




the
extra
parliamentary
committee
resumed
its


sittings

on
january












six
years
of
the
true
republic
having
now
been
spent
in
these
desperate


efforts
to
deal
with
the

beautiful
and
generous
idea


and
the
election


of
a
new
chamber
being
imminent
for
the
autumn
of


m



waldeck
rousseau

minister
of
the
interior

proceeded
to
lay
before
the


re
awakened
committee

what

a
project
of
a
law
to
relieve
the


co
operative
idea
from
the
crushing
weight
of
the
imperial
law
of




not
a
bit
of
it







he
proceeded

it
is
still
brother
doumer
who
speaks


to
lay
before
the


committee


a
summary
of
the
studies
upon
which
it
ought
to
enter









according
to
brother
doumer
this

summary

was
truly
grand
and
even



vast


but
alas


the
general
elections


says
brother
doumer

sadly




and
afterwards
successive
ministerial
crises


suspended
the
inquiry


during
more
than
two
years


it
was
only
in

that
the


extra
parliamentary
committee
resumed
its
labours








the
universal
exposition
of

was
then
organising
and


organising

let
me
ask
you
not
for
a
moment
to
forget

with
a
specific


eye

not
so
much
to
the

principles
of



about
which
our
worthy


ministers
care
as
much
as
they
do
about
the
edict
of
nantes
or
the


philosophy
of
pascal

as
to
the
legislative
elections
of








so
what
did
the
extra
parliamentary
committee
do
in
this

ninth
year



of
the
one

true
republic

for
the

beautiful
and
generous
idea

of


co
operation







they
adopted
a
decree


a
firm
and
practical
decree


promulgated
june







permitting
several
co
operative
societies
to
contract
for


public
works

especially
in
connection
with
the
exposition


and
they


also
adopted

two
projects
of
laws









the
first
of
these
projects


it
is
still
brother
doumer
who
speaks





aimed
at
the
creation
of
a
general
provident
fund

industrial



commercial

and
agricultural

to
be
managed
by
the

caisse
des
depots
et


consignations










this
very
interesting
project


says
brother
doumer



has
not
yet


been
submitted
to
the
chamber


sent
up
to
be
examined
by
the
ministry


of
the
interior
to
the
ministry
of
commerce

it
is
there
undergoing

a


prolonged
and
inexplicable
delay









no

no

brother
doumer


prolonged

if
you
like

but
not



inexplicable








and
so

after
now

ten
years


we
have
the
true
republic
which
got


complete
possession
in

of
all
the
machinery
for
giving
force
and


effect
to
the

beautiful
and
generous

idea
of
co
operation

and
for


giving
wings
to
that
idea

leaving
it
still
under
the
blighting
curse
of


the
imperial
law
of








and
doumer
alone

brother
doumer

whom
providence
and
the
freemasons
of


laon
sent
to
the
chamber
in


has
met
the
questions
which
have
been



urgent

ever
since

with
the
grand
practical
solution
of
a

report



fifteen
pages
long

and
of
a

project
of
law

consisting
of
six
titles


and
about
a
hundred
clauses







take
this
pamphlet
with
you


said
my
friend

after
going
over
it
with


me


take
it

look
into
it
minutely

and
tell
me
if
anything
you
have


ever
heard
or
read
in
the
way
of
our
conservative
attacks
upon
the


flatulence

the
fatuity

and
the
hypocrisy
of
these
pretended
friends
of


labour
and
of
the
working
man
is
to
be
compared

for
cold
blooded


cruelty

with
this
exposition
made
by
brother
doumer
of
the
methods
of


his
party







i
don
t
know


he
added


what
portfolio
brother
doumer
expects
to
get


if
the
government
carry
these
elections
of


he
has
kicked
m

de


freycinet

as
you
see

into
one
corner

and
president
carnot
into


another

for
the
benefit
of
his
friend
and
ally

m

floquet

so
i


suppose
he
expects
to
secure
some
commanding
position

neither
m

de


freycinet
nor
president
carnot
being
strong
enough
to
resent
the


impertinences
of
an
eminent
freemason

but
wherever
they
put
him

this


wonderful
report
of
his
ought
to
be
printed
and
circulated
freely
all


over
france
by
the
conservative
committees

it
is
the
most
concise
and


eloquent
history

that
i
know

of
ten
years
of
the
true
republic
in
its


relation
to
the
working
classes
of
france

you
have
seen
at
st

gobain


the
results
of
a
co
operative
association
of
working
men
organized
under


statutes
drawn
up
by
a
practical
and
liberal
friend
of
labour

m



cochin

in


a
year
before
the
imperial
law
of

was
passed







wherever
elsewhere
in
france
you
find
the
principle
of
co
operation


adopted
and
bearing
fruit
for
the
benefit
of
working
men

pray
remember


that
the

true
republic

has
for
ten
years
persistently
evaded
and


dodged
the
problems
with
which
the
empire
grappled

and
to
which
the


emperor
gave
a
practical
answer
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago







after
following
my
friend
carefully
through
his
amusing
and
instructive


vivisection
of
the
report
presented
to
the
late
chamber
by
the
masonic


member
for
laon
upon
the
project
of
law
touching
co
operation
proposed


by
m

floquet

i
was
not
surprised

of
course

to
learn
that
the



project

still
remains
a

project


it
was
adopted
in
what
is
called
a



friday
session

by
the
chamber

and
then
sent
up
to
die
a
natural
death


in
the
senate

the
senate

be
it
remembered

being
the
absolute


stronghold
of
the
existing
republican
government






so
that
still

after
ten
years
of
power

the
republicans
of
m

doumer
s



true
republic

leave
the
working
men
of
france

so
far
as
co
operation


can
affect
their
interests

under
the
control
of
a
law
passed
under
the


empire
more
than
twenty
years
ago






clearly
one
of
two
things
must
be
true

either
this
law

passed
under


the
empire
more
than
twenty
years
ago

is
a
good
and
sufficient
law



assuring
to
the
working
men
of
france
all
the
advantages

and
protecting


them
against
all
the
disadvantages

incident
to
the
principle
of


co
operation

so
far
as
this
influence
and
this
protection
can
be
given


by
laws

or
the
republicans
of
m

doumer
s

true
republic

have
been


humbugging
and
trifling
with
the
working
men
of
france
on
the
subject


ever
since
they
contrived

ten
years
ago

to
get
the
control
of
power
at


paris

upon
one
horn
or
the
other
of
this
dilemma

the

true


republicans

clearly
must
elect
to
take
their
seats






the
voters
of
laon
would
appear
to
be
of
the
mind
that
the

true


republicans

of
m

doumer
have
been
humbugging
and
trifling
with
them



for
at
the
election
of
this
year

m

doumer
lost
his
seat

and
the


candidate
favoured
by
my
boulangist
figaro
at
laon

m

castelin

was


elected

what
followed
is
worth
noting

to
complete
this
picture
of
the


working
of
representative
institutions
in
one
of
the
great
french


provinces
under
the
third
republic






m

doumer

in
his
address
to
the
electors
of
the
aisne

issued
at
laon


on
august




was
at
great
pains
to
explain
what
his
own
relations


had
been
with
boulangism
and
with
general
boulanger
in


before
he


became
a
deputy
from
laon
in
the
place
of
m

ringuier







i
frankly
admit


he
observes
in
this
very
curious
document


that
i


felt
a
lively
sympathy
with
general
boulanger

while
he
was
minister
of


war





in
the
journal
which
i
conducted
i
insisted
on
his
being
put


back
into
the
cabinet

on
the
fall
of
the
goblet
ministry







when

by
the
death
of
m

ringuier
in
the
early
spring
of


a
seat


from
the
aisne
was
suddenly
vacated

the
freemasons
of
laon

as
i
have


stated

selected
m

doumer
as
the
republican
candidate
to
fill
it

m



doumer
s
friend

m

floquet

was
not
then
at
the
head
of
the
government



and
general
boulanger
was
still
in
command
of
his
army
corps
at


clermont

coming
up
to
paris

as
the
government
affirmed

disguised
and


wearing
blue
spectacles

to
organise
political
mischief

and
generally


making
himself
a
terror
and
a
trouble
to
the

true
republicans


who
had


made
a
great
man
of
him
for
their
own
purposes







eight
days
before
the
election

which
was
fixed
for
march







says
m

doumer

in
his
address
of
this
year
to
the
voters


i
had
no


competitor

and
my
election
seemed
to
be
certain








no
doubt

the

brethren

had
arranged
everything






but
suddenly
the
skies
darkened

the
government
of
m

tirard
plucked
up


courage
to
make
head
against
the

brav

general


general
boulanger
was


relieved
of
his
command
at
clermont






thereupon
the
boulangists
resolved
to
avail
themselves
of
the


impending
election
at
laon
as
an
opportunity
of
responding
to
the
attack


of
the
government
by
a
demonstration
of
their
strength
in
the
provinces



and
m

doumer
was
suddenly
served
with
a
notice
that
the
seat
of
which


he
had
felt
so
sure
would
be
wanted
for
general
boulanger






it
was
a
cruel
and
a
critical
moment

what
was
to
be
done

to
withdraw


from
the
contest
was
to
take
sides
virtually
with
general
boulanger


against
the
tirard
government

and
much
as
m

floquet
and
the
friends
of


m

doumer
disliked
m

tirard

they
were
not
ready
to
throw
in
their
lot


at
that
moment
against
him

so
the
brethren

as
my
friend
believes

were


called
upon
to
bring
about
an
arrangement

what
general
boulanger
wanted


was
not
to
fill
the
seat
for
laon

it
was
only
to
be
elected
to
fill
the


seat
for
laon

plainly

therefore

the
course
of
practical
wisdom

for


m

doumer
was
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
the
friends
of
general


boulanger

so
this
was
done






the
parisian
committee
of
the
general
came
into
the
aisne

and
at
a


conference

which
m

doumer
admits
that
he
held
with
them
at
tergnier



it
was
agreed
that
after
the
first
balloting

on
march



the
voters


who
then
voted
for
general
boulanger
as
a
protest

should
vote
for
m



doumer
at
the
second
balloting

and
so
elect
him







the
first
balloting
came
off
in
due
course
of
time

both
m

doumer

the


republican
candidate

and
m

jacquemont

the
conservative
candidate



were
left
in
the
rear
by
general
boulanger

who
received
some
forty


thousand
votes

the
election
being
held
in

under
the

scrutin
de


liste

adopted

before
the
elections
of


by
the
republicans

in


order
to
remedy
what
they
had
denounced
as
the

intolerable

evils
of


the

scrutin
d
arrondissement


under
the
stress
of
the
boulangist


panic

these
same
republicans
suddenly
threw
the

scrutin
de
liste

over


again
in


to
readopt
and
reimpose
upon
their
beloved
country
the



intolerable

evils
of
the

scrutin
d
arrondissement







the
second
balloting
was
to
take
place
on
march


suppose
that
general


boulanger
should
take
it
into
his
head
to
force
the
fighting
on
that
day


at
laon

worse
still

try
to
make
an

arrangement

with
the
conservative


candidate

what
would
then
become
of
m

doumer

so

on
march


m



doumer
tells
us
he
went
up
to
paris

from
laon
in
company
with
the


chairman
of
one
of
the
republican
committees

and
there
had
an
interview


with
a
leading
member
of
the
committee
of
general
boulanger

the
result


of
which
was
that
the

brav

general

published
a
letter

in
which
he


announced
to
the
electors
of
the
aisne
that
he
could
not
accept
a
seat


which
he
could
only
occupy
to
the
detriment
of
competitors

beside
whom



and
not
against
whom

he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
made
a
candidate


he


wound
up
by
requesting
his
friends
in
the
aisne

to
vote
at
the
second


balloting
for
the
candidate
who
would
best
support
the
honour
of
the


country
and
the
interests
of
the
republic







then
came

at
laon

a
meeting
of
the
republican
committee
of
the
aisne



at
which
the
chairman
of
the
meeting

m

lesguillier

was
instructed
to


do
his
best
to

dissipate
the
somewhat
equivocal
effect

of
the


language
used
by
general
boulanger
in
his
letter

and
to
induce
the


boulangist
committee
to
work

on
the
st

for
the
election
of
m



doumer

and
so

on
march




m

doumer
was
finally
put
into
the


seat

which
enabled
him
to
draw
up
his
model
report
on
the
great


question
of

co
operation


that
the
boulangists
of
laon
are
not
wholly


delighted
with
the
course
of
m

doumer
in
the
late
chamber

and
that
the


working
men
of
laon
are
not
deeply
impressed
by
the
value
to
them
of
his


model
report
on

co
operation


may
be
inferred
from
his
defeat
by
the


boulangist
candidate
m

castelin
under
the

scrutin
d
arrondissement

in


september








but
m

doumer
is
a
typical
french
politician
of
the
third
republic

and


as
his
alliance
with
m

floquet
seems
to
be
firmer
than
ever

my
friend


in
the
aisne
is
probably
right
in
thinking
that
m

doumer
will
still
be


heard
of
perhaps
as
a
prefect

perhaps
as
a
deputy
filling
the
seat
of


some

invalidated

deputy
from
paris

perhaps
as
a
tresorier
general



occupying
one
of
the
large
number

i
think
there
are
eighty
in
all

of


these
lucrative
posts

which
it
has
been
the
custom
of
successive


administrations
under
the
third
republic
to
distribute
among
their


friends
and
supporters
on
retiring
from
power

as
in
england
premiers



in
like
circumstances

distribute
peerages
and
baronetcies
and
accolades


of
knighthood

one
special
difference
between
the
two
systems
being
that


the
rewards
of
political
service
bestowed
in
england
not
only
entail
no


expense
upon
the
taxpayers

but
actually

i
believe

bring
a
certain


amount
in
the
way
of
fees
into
the
treasury

whereas
in
france
such


rewards
mean
a
steady
increase
of
the
public
outlay






as
the
late
parliament
on
the
very
last
day
of
its
existence
adopted
a


plan
proposed
by
m

doumer
himself
for
re
organising
the
system
of



tresoriers
generaux


and
making
these
officers
regular
members
of
the


staff
of
the
finance
ministry
with
fixed
salaries

my
friend
in
the


aisne
thinks
it
likely
enough
that
one
of
these
posts
may
fill
the


eventual
perspective
of
m

doumer
s
political
career






meanwhile
the
defeated
candidate
for
laon
has
been
comfortably
lodged



at
the
public
cost

in
the
legislative
palace

as
secretary
of
the


president
of
the
chamber

m

floquet
being
president

and
receives
a


salary
of


francs

with
perquisites
and
other
advantages






we
do
this
sort
of
thing
occasionally
in
the
united
states

for
the


benefit
of
defeated
political
candidates

but
in
one
important
respect


the
professional
politician
in
france
is
better
off
than
the


professional
politician
in
america

our
pension
list
is
by
far
the


largest
in
the
world

but
we
do
not
offer
any
prospect
of
a
pension
to


civil
servants






nor
have
we
so
many
paid
legislative
berths
in
which
to
lodge
our


professional
politicians

the
parliamentary
business
of
the
sixty


millions
of
people
who
now
inhabit
the
united
states
is
done
by


eighty
four
senators
and

representatives

who
receive
something
over






a
year

the
parliamentary
business
of
less
than
forty


millions
of
people
inhabiting
france
is
supposed
to
require
the
services


of

senators
and

deputies

who
receive
for
doing
it





francs

or

in
round
numbers

about





whether
the

french


legislators
really
earn
half
a
million
of
dollars
more
by
their
annual


labours
than
do
the

american
legislators
is
a
question
which
i
leave


my
readers
to
settle
after
they
shall
have
settled
the
previous


question

whether
either
of
those
considerable
sums
of
money
is
really


earned
by
either
body

but
there
can
be
no
doubt

i
think

that

under


the
existing
economical
conditions
of
society
in
the
two
republics

the


aggregate
number
of
professional
politicians
aiming
at
the

prizes
of


the
profession
in
france
is
likely
to
be
considerably
in
excess
of
the


aggregate
number
of
professional
politicians
aiming
at
the

prizes
of


the
profession
in
the
united
states

of
course

too

this
increase
in


the
aggregate
number
of
the
competitors
must
necessarily
be
attended
by


a
decline
in
the
average
standard
of
character
and
capacity
among
them



and
as
it
is
the
settled
policy
of
the
french
republicans
of
the

true


republic


who
have
been
in
power
for
the
past
decade

to
exclude
all


persons
not
of
their
party
from
any
share
in
the
general
administration


of
the
republic

it
is
obvious
that
this
lowering
of
the
level
of


character
and
of
capacity
must
be
most
marked
among
the
professional


politicians
of
the
republican
party

this
is
a
matter
of
scientific


necessity

and
not
at
all
of
sentiment

and
it
suffices
to
account
for


the
unquestionable
average
inferiority
of
the
government
members
of
the


senate
and
the
chamber
to
the
opposition
members
in
point
both
of


character
and
of
capacity






the
intense
centralisation
of
power
in
france
is
another
and
a
very


important
force
working
in
the
same
direction

outside
of
the
federal


field
of
political
ambition
in
the
united
states
we
have
the
state


governments

but
there
can
be
no
more
than
forty
two
state
governors
in


the
united
states

whereas
in
france
there
are
eighty
six
prefects

and


three
in
algiers

without
counting
the
administrative
authorities
in
the


regency
of
tunis
and
in
the
french
colonies

the
governorships
of
the


american
states
are
elective
offices

to
be
won
only
by
local
services


and
local
combinations

but
the
administrative
prizes
of
french
politics


can
only
be
secured
through
the
central
administration
at
paris

under


pressure
from
the
all
powerful
cliques
and
combinations
in
the
national


legislature

briefly

therefore

it
seems
to
me
quite
clear
that
under


the
third
republic
in
france
the
profession
of
politics
is
rapidly


becoming

if
it
has
not
already
become

much
more
easy
of
access

and



in
proportion
to
the
capital
of
character
and
of
ability
required
for


entering
upon
it

much
more
remunerative

than
it
has
ever
yet
been
in


the
united
states

unless
perhaps
during
the
domination
of
mr

tweed
and


the
tammany
ring
over
the
taxpayers
of
new
york















chapter
xi





in
the
nord










valenciennes





it
says
but
little
for
what
texans
call
the

sabe

of
the
municipal


authorities
of
valenciennes
that
this

which
ought
to
be
one
of
the
most


picturesque
and
attractive

is
really
one
of
the
shabbiest
historic


towns
of
north
eastern
france

the
streets
are
ill
paved
and
ill
kept



the
public
buildings
are
untidy

and
the
whole
place
contrasts
most


unfavourably

from
this
point
of
view

with
the
rich
and
beautifully


cultivated
region
through
which
you
reach
it
by
the
railway
from
douai



this
is
the
finest
agricultural
region
in
france

the
old
french


flanders

a

fat

country
as
well
as
a
flat

you
hardly
see
a
weed


between
douai
and
valenciennes

great
fields
of
beetroot
are
cultivated


like
flower
gardens

and
the
green
and
growing
crops
are
as
daintily


ordered
as
the
coils
and
plateaux
of
flowers
with
which
it
is
the


fashion
to
adorn
dinner
tables

a
la
russe


it
is
not
pleasant
to
be


assured
that
the
industrious
dwellers
in
this
land
of
goshen
are
as
fond


of
cock
fighting
as
the
spaniards

who
probably
enough
introduced
the


amusement
here
during
their
long
domination
over
what
is
now
known
as


french
flanders

and
that
they
are
addicted
also
in
a
systematic
way
to


the
abominable
practice
of
blinding
bullfinches
to
make
them
better


singers

i
am
told
that
in
many
communes
the
authorities
actually
give


prizes
for
the
best
singing
birds
thus
produced

and
that

blind


bullfinch
societies

are
among
the
many
associations
regularly


established
and
nourishing
among
the
fields
and
villages

the
old


flemish
love
of
strong
drink
also
survives
here

as
is
shown
by
the


number
and
the
prosperous
appearance
of
the
cabarets






these
average

for
the
whole
department
of
the
nord

no
fewer
than
one


to
every
sixty
six
inhabitants

and
around
valenciennes

the
proportion


rises
as
high
as
one
to
every
forty
four

there
is
much
subdivision
of


property

but
it
has
not
been
pushed
so
far
around
valenciennes
as
in


some
other
portions
of
the
department

a
majority
of
the
small


properties
extending
to
twenty
five
hectares

and
properties
of
from
one


hundred
to
three
hundred
hectares
being
considered
large
estates






thanks
to
the
energy
and
intelligence
of
many
considerable
landholders



a
great
improvement
has
taken
place
of
late
years
in
the
agricultural


methods
and
instruments
in
use
throughout
this
department

the
open


drains
have
practically
disappeared

the
country
has
become
more


wholesome

as
well
as
more
fertile

and
the
farmers
in
general
are


admittedly
much
better
off

despite
the
crisis

this
increasing


prosperity
is
given
as
an
explanation
of
the
decreasing
average
number


of
children






but
french
flanders
is
nevertheless
one
of
the
densely
populated
parts


of
france

showing
a
population
of

to
the
square
league

it
is


proper
to
say

however

that
this
is
chiefly
due
to
the
growth
of


certain
great
manufacturing
centres

in
the
rural
regions
the
population


is
much
less
dense

and
the
population
of
valenciennes
is
actually


declining

it
fell
from


in

to


in


the


explanation
is
that
people
are
moving
out
from
valenciennes
into
the
new


suburbs

anzin

thiers

denain

and
st

amand
are
increasing
with
the


development
of
the
manufactories
which
are
growing
up
here
around
the


great
coal
fields






while
i
was
at
valenciennes

there
was
a
terrible
commotion
in
the
paris


newspapers
over
a
certain
colonel
in
the
army

who

being
in
the
service


of
a
well
known
arms
factory

loudly
protested
against
the
alleged
sale


of
that
factory
to
the
germans

and
the
threatened
consequent
closing
of


its
works
near
paris






after
much
journalistic
and
parliamentary
gunpowder
had
been
burned

it


came
to
light
that
the
proprietors
were
simply
making
up
their
minds
to


transfer
their
works
to
the
vicinity
of
valenciennes
as
a
necessary


measure
of
economy






notwithstanding
the
slovenly

edility

of
valenciennes

i
found
it
a


very
interesting
place

the
hotel
du
commerce
there
is
a
very
well
kept


old
fashioned
hostelry

installed
in
a
stately
and
spacious
house

long


the
residence
of
a
considerable
family

indeed

one
of
my
friends
in


valenciennes
was
quite
severe
in
his
comments
upon
the
indifference
of


the
head
of
this
family

still
a
man
of
large
property

to
this


conversion
of
the
ancestral
mansion
into
an
inn

with
its
fine
gateway



its
porter
s
lodge
on
either
hand

its
large
courtyard
shaded
with


well
grown
old
trees

and
its
well
proportioned
apartments

it
is


certainly
a
specimen
worth
preserving
of
such
a
house
as
king
louis
need


not
have
disdained
to
enter

when
he
made
valenciennes
and
french


flanders
definitely
french
in








we
have
a
noisy

ignorant
set
of
people
in
power
here
now


said
my


friend


who
pulled
down

not
long
ago

the
finest
of
the
only
three


good
gates
we
had
left

out
of
sheer
stupidity

and
you
can
see
how
they


let
things
go
at
sixes
and
sevens
all
over
the
city

but
the


old
established
citizens
of
valenciennes
are
to
blame
also

not
for
the


decline
of
our
population
perhaps

but
for
the
gradual
disappearance
of


all
the
features
of
the
city
worth
preserving

like
the
head
of
this


family

they
care
nothing
about
the
past







in
the
course
of
a
walk
about
the
city

he
showed
me

in
the
rue


notre
dame

an
edifice

the
condition
of
which
certainly
excused
his


criticism
of
his
fellow
citizens






it
is
an
ancient
dwelling
house
of
the
fifteenth
century

standing
at


the
corner
of
two
streets

a
most
graceful

tourelle

markes
the
facade



and
strikingly
resembles
that
which
decorates
still
the
house
at
paris


near
the
rue
des
francs
bourgeois

in
the
vaulted
doorway
of
which


louis

duc
d
orleans

was
murdered

a
crime
avenged
by
the
death

on
the


bridge
of
montereau

of
its
real
author

jean
sans
peur

duc
de


bourgogne

the
exterior
ornamentation
of
this
house
is
admirable

nor
is


it
too
far
gone
in
dilapidation
to
be
successfully
restored

the
door


was
locked

boardings
were
fixed
in
some
of
the
beautiful
windows

and


advertisements
of
amer
picon
and
auctions
and
political
meetings
defaced


the
front

obviously
the
house
belonged
originally
to
some
personage
of


importance
at
a
time
when
valenciennes

the
city
of
the
emperor


valentinian

was
still
one
of
the
great
marts
of
western
europe
and
a


capital
of
the
civilisation
of
the
west

its
population
was
then
much


larger
than
it
now
is

by
the
scheldt

it
communicated
with
the
sea

and


in
the
thirteenth
century
it
was
a
member
of
the
famous
hanse
of
london



which
included
also

reims

st

quentin

douai

arras

st

omer



abbeville

amiens

bruges

ypres

and
ghent

this
league
dominated
over


the
channel

its
chief

the
count
of
the
hanse

who
seems
to
have
been


in
a
manner
a
successor
of
the
roman
counts
of
the
saxon
shore

was


chosen
by
the
leagued
cities
from
among
the
great
burghers
of
bruges



the
privileges
its
representatives
enjoyed
in
london
were
balanced
by


sundry
rather
monastic
restrictions

but
it
was
a
great
commercial


corporation

and
it
played
a
great
part
in
the
social
and
economical


history
of
mediaeval
europe

as
early
as
the
ninth
century
valenciennes


and
mons
had
been
so
rich
and
influential

that
they
were
regarded
as


the
pillars
of
the


noble
comte
de
hainault

tenu
de
dieu
et
du


soleil



with
the
crusades

the
importance
of
valenciennes
notably


increased

and
with
its
importance
the
independence
of
its
burghers

the


leading
part
taken
by
godfrey
de
bouillon
in
the
early
crusades
is
a


proof
of
the
power
of
these
flemish
towns

when
baldwin
of
flanders


assumed
the
imperial
purple
at
constantinople

he
did
it
expressly
to


benefit
the
commerce
of
the
flemish
cities

at
this
day
it
is
believed


that
there
exist

in
some
palace
of
the
sultan
at
constantinople



tapestries
of
oudenarde
taken
to
the
east
by
baldwin

who
was
born
at


valenciennes
in


at
valenciennes

too

were
born
his
sister



isabelle
of
hainault

the
first
wife
of
philip
augustus
of
france

his


brother
henry

emperor
of
the
east

and
his
two
daughters

one
of
these


daughters

marguerite

grown
to
woman
s
estate

besieged
valenciennes


because
the
burghers
refused
to
recognise
her
as
the
born
countess
of


hainault

gilles
miniave

provost
of
the
city

plainly
said
to
her
when


he
refused
to
surrender


we
have
taken
and
we
intend
to
kill
your


soldiers

madame

as
abettors
of
tyranny


this
was
as
much
to
the


purpose
in
its
way
as
the
firing
on
the
royal
troops
by
the
farmers
of


lexington
in
america
in







in
the
middle
of
the
fourteenth
century
valenciennes
was
so
wealthy
that


jean
party

provost
in


was
regarded
as
the
richest
man
in
europe



he
went
to
paris
during
the
fair
of
the
landit

and
for
his
own
account


bought
up
all
the
goods
brought
there
for
sale
at
one
swoop

he
then


retailed
them
at
a
great
profit

he
was
invited
to
attend
the
court
of


france

and
went
there
so
magnificently
attired
as
to
excite
the


jealousy
of
the
french
nobles

who
treated
him
in
consequence
with
undue


arrogance

he
took
off
his
cloak

enriched
with
fur
and
jewels

as
no


seat
was
offered
him

made
it
into
a
roll

and
sate
down
on
it

when
he


rose
with
the
rest
to
leave

he
left
the
cloak
where
he
had
sate
on
it



the
royal
heralds

dazzled
by
the
splendour
of
the
garment

gathered
it


up

and
one
of
them
hastened
with
it
after
jean
party

calling
out
to


him
that
he
had
forgotten
it







in
my
country


said
the
haughty
burgher
turning
towards
the
herald




it
is
not
the
custom
for
people
to
take
their
cushions
away
with
them







one
of
the
predecessors
of
this
proud
citizen

jean
bernier

gave
a


banquet
in

to
all
the
allies
of
the
comte
de
flanders

which
is


celebrated
by
the
chroniclers
as
the
grandest
ever
seen
in
flanders



there
were
sixty
nine
guests

including
the
kings
of
bohemia
and
of


navarre

and
six
tables

so
sumptuous
with
gold
and
silver
plate

that


the
like
had
never
been
seen







in

a
chapter
was
held
at
valenciennes
of
the
golden
fleece

in



the
city
entertained
charles
v


the
dauphin

and
the
duc
d
orleans

in



a
society
called

the
principality
of
pleasure

gave
a
festival
to



guests
in
the
woolstaplers

hall

each
guest
was
equipped
with
two


flagons
of
silver

one
for
wine
and
the
other
for
beer

and


pieces


of
silver
and
gold
plate
furnished
forth
the
table

of
which
the


chronicler
observes

to
the
undying
glory
of
the
city

that

all
these


vessels
of
silver
and
gold
belonged
to
dwellers
at
valenciennes

and


also
that

not
one
piece
was
lost








the
glory
passed
away
from
valenciennes
with
the
religious
wars

the


place
became
a
headquarters
of
protestantism

and
the
most
catholic
king


sent
his
armies
to
deal
with
it

the
spaniards
took
valenciennes
and


long
held
it

in


under
conde

they
beat
off
the
french
under


turenne

and
it
was
only
in

that
louis
xiv

finally
captured
it



and
turned
it
over
to
vauban
to
be
fortified






as
the
town
stands
much
lower
than
the
surrounding
country

vauban


planned
his
works
with
an
eye
to
flooding
the
region

if
necessary

by


the
waters
of
the
scheldt

valenciennes
stands
at


metres
above
the


sea
level

but
anzin

the
chief
suburb

is
at

metres

and
the
hills


beyond
at

metres
above
the
sea
level






when
the
spaniards
got
the
upper
hand
fairly
in
french
flanders



thousands
of
the
workers
in
wool
emigrated
to
england

carrying
their


industry
with
them

many
of
these
emigrants
naturally
went
into
the


cloth
making
west
of
england

and
to
this
day
i
am
told
by
genealogists


flemish
names

translated
or
curiously
transmogrified

are
to
be
found


in
somerset
and
devonshire

which
attest
the
extent
and
value
to
england


of
the
exodus

what
its
real
proportions
were
it
is
hard
now
to


estimate

the
chroniclers
talk
of
a
hundred
thousand
people
going
out


from
flanders
to
england
between
the
defeat
of
the
armada
in

and


the
repulse
of
the
french
from
before
valenciennes
in


but
the


numbers
are
obviously
conjectural






what
is
certain
is

that
during
this
period
valenciennes
was
the
centre


of
a
most
interesting
spiral
movement

to
use
the
phrase
of
goethe

in


the
history
of
modern
europe

coming
down
later
to
the
contest
between


france

under
louis
xiv


and
the
allies

led
by
marlborough
and
prince


eugene

we
find
valenciennes
again
playing
a
leading
part

and
during


the
last
blind

desperate
effort
of
france
to
shake
off
the
domination


of
the
scoundrels
who
had
fastened
themselves
upon
her
vitals
at
paris


after
the
collapse
of
the
monarchy

valenciennes
became
the
theatre
of


the
tolerably
well
conceived

but
intolerably
ill
executed

attempt
of


dumouriez
to
make
himself
a
french
duke
of
albemarle

it
was
quite
as


unprincipled
as
his
political
operations
were
at
paris
in


and
in


both
cases
he
came
to
grief
through
his
overweening
self
confidence
and


consequent
lack
of
the
most
ordinary
prudence
and
forecast






a
morning
may
be
spent
with
both
profit
and
pleasure
in
the
galleries
of


the
hotel
de
ville
at
valenciennes

the
building
is
of
the
early


seventeenth
century

and
was
remodelled
and
partially
reconstructed


under
the
second
empire

it
is
spacious
and
not
without
a
certain


dignity

but

like
the
streets
and
squares

it
is
ill
kept






the
galleries
which
occupy
the
whole
of
the
second
floor
are
extensive



well
lighted

and
with
a
more
careful
and
systematic
arrangement
of
the


pictures
would
be
of
considerable
value
to
students
of
art

valenciennes


certainly
had
painters
of
merit
before
the
sixteenth
century

one
of


these

celebrated
by
froissart

maitre
andre

was
both
a
sculptor
and
a


painter

in

he
became

imagier

of
charles
v

of
france

the


statues
of
that
king

of
jeanne
de
bourbon
his
queen

and
of
king
john


and
king
philip

still
extant
at
st

are
his
work

two
exquisite


manuscripts
illuminated
by
him
still
exist

one
in
the
bibliotheque


nationale
at
paris

the
other
at
brussels






simon
marmion

who
died
at
valenciennes
on
christmas
day



was
the


court
painter
of
that
high
and
puissant
prince

philippe

duc
de


bourgogne

and
ranked
among
the
chiefs
of
the
flemish
school

pictures


of
his
exist
at
bruges

nuremberg

and
paris

the
valenciennes
museum


has
an

ex
voto

on
wood

the
history
of
which
is
curious

it
was
found


broken
into
two
pieces

and
hidden
away
behind
a
confessional
in
the


cathedral
of
notre
dame

how
it
came
there
no
one
knows

it
may
have


been
flung
there
during
the
pillage
of
the
church

or
put
there
to
save


it

at
all
events

having
been
carefully

not
too
carefully

restored


and
cleaned

it
now
presents
two
interesting
pictures

one
of
st

john



holding
in
his
right
hand
a
book
on
which
the
paschal
lamb
reposes

with


an
ecclesiastic
kneeling
before
him
in
a
red
robe

covered
with
a


transparent
alb

a
palm
resting
on
his
right
arm

the
other
represents
a


dead
body
on
a
rug

half
covered
with
a
shroud

above

on
a
scroll

are


the
lines







da
requiem
cunctis

deus

hic
et
ubique
sepultis





ut
sint
in
requie

propter
tua
vulnera
quinque






in

the
provost
of
valenciennes

the
baron
pujol
de
lagrave

who


served
as
provost
till


and
again
after
the
capture
of
the
city
by


the
duke
of
york

established
here
a
school
of
art
not
unworthy
the


birthplace
of
watteau
and
of
pater

both
of
these
painters
are


represented
in
the
collection

the
former
by
a
characteristic
little



conversation
under
the
trees
in
a
park

and
by
an
interesting
portrait


of
the
sculptor
pater

the
father
of
the
painter

the
two
families
of


watteau
and
of
pater
lived
on
terms
of
such
friendly
intimacy
at


valenciennes
that
the
father
of
pater
sent
his
son
up
to
paris

to
study


his
art
under
watteau






watteau
received
his
young
compatriot
so
coldly

and
made
things
so


unpleasant
for
him

that
he
soon
went
back
discouraged

to
resume
his


career
at
home

there
he
encountered
the
hostility
of
the
local


corporation
of
st

luke

that
guild
of
painters
refusing
to
allow
him
to


practise
his
art
without
regularly
passing
through
his
apprenticeship



and
taking
his

master
s
degree


pater
resisted

and
the
case
went


before
the
magistracy
of
valenciennes

before
the
provincial
council
of


hainault

and
finally
before
the
parliament
of
flanders

it
was


contested
for
several
years

and
finally
resulted
in
an
arrangement



under
which
pater
bound
himself
never
to
paint
in
valenciennes


under


any
pretext
whatsoever


he
might
go
to
paris
and
paint
as
much
as
he


liked

but
in
valenciennes
painting
was
the
privilege
of
the
corporation


of
st

luke

this
has
a
pre
adamite
sound
in
modern
ears

but
even
now


no
man
may
lawfully
kill
or
cure
the
sick
in
london
or
paris
or
new
york


without
a
diploma

despite
the

epoch
making

principles
of


and


the
new
french
chamber
of

apparently
intends
to
forbid
all
foreign


physicians
to
attend
upon
patients
in
france

in
valenciennes

as
a


matter
of
fact

a
liberal
school
of
art
was
established
in


by


which
time
both
watteau
and
pater
had
done
their
life
s
work
and
taken


their
places
among
the
masters
in
a
world
wide
corporation
of
st

luke






two
charming
groups
by
pater
represent
this
painter
in
the
museum
of
his


native
city

together
with
a
portrait
of
his
sister

bequeathed
by
m



bertin

the
last
representative
of
the
pater
family
in
valenciennes






a
grand
and
well
known
triptych
by
rubens

representing
the
preaching



the
martyrdom

and
the
entombment
of
st

stephen

in
three
compartments



upon
the
extension
of
which

when
closed

appears
a
bold
and
striking


picture
of
the
annunciation

is
one
of
the
chief
treasures
of
the


museum

it
belonged
to
the
noble
monastery
of
st

amand

which
was


wrecked
and
pillaged
during
the
revolution

and

with
the
valuable


library
of
the
monastery

very
rich
in
missals
and
manuscripts

was


confiscated
by
the
patriots
of
valenciennes






another
rubens

of
less
importance

originally
belonged
to
the
church
of


notre
dame
de
la
chaussee

which
was
pulled
down

as
well
as
pillaged



at
the
same
time

it
seems
to
have
been
rescued
from
the
spoilers
by
the


good
people
of
the
neighbourhood

and
was
honestly
bought
for
the
museum


in


not
magnificently

presented

to
it
by
official

receivers




not
much
better
than
the
original
thieves






francois
pourbus
of
bruges
is
represented
here
by
two
admirable


full
length
portraits
of
philippe
emanuel
de
croy

comte
de
solre

and


of
his
sister

marie
de
croy

and
by
a
full
length
portrait
of
dorothee


de
croy

duchesse
d
arschot

in
a
stately
wedding
dress

painted

in
the


full
maturity
of
his
powers

at
paris

in


this
is
the


wedding
dress
described

according
to
m

foucart

an
accomplished


amateur
of
valenciennes

one
of
the
conservators
of
the
museum

by


reiffenberg
in
his
valuable
book



une
existence
de
grand
seigneur
au


xvi^e
siecle



and
the
valenciennes
museum
is
particularly
rich
in


pictures
of
interest
from
this

which
may
be
called
the
documentary



point
of
view






among
these
must
be
reckoned
a
curious
painting
of
the
mother
and
the


wife
of
henri
iii


with
sundry
dames
of
high
degree

and
women
of
the


people
violently
squabbling
together
over
a
pair
of
trunk
hose

the


property
of
the
king

who
lies
prostrate
in
one
corner
of
the
canvas



struck
down
by
the
clenched
fist
of
a
man
in
the
robes
of
a
member
of


the
parliament
of
paris






from
this
and
from
another
painting
on
parchment
which
sets
forth

as
an


inscription
recites


the
cruel
martyrdom
of
the
most
reverend
cardinal


de
guise
by
the
inhuman
tyrant
henri
de
valois


it
may
be
clearly


gathered
that
the
people
of
french
flanders
had
very
positive
opinions



and
were
not
slow
to
express
them

long
before
the
abbe
sieyes


constituted
himself
the
isaac
newton
of
political
science






there
is
a
goodly
show

too

of
historical
portraits
of
interest

one
of


the
admiral
de
coligny

which
was
exhibited
at
paris
in


another
of


fenelon

which
came
here
from
the
pillage
of
the
chapterhouse
of


cambray

another
of
prince
maurice
of
nassau

another
of
hortense


mancini

a
good
full
length
portrait
of
bardo
bardi
magalotti

colonel


of
the

royal
italian

regiment
under
louis
xiv


is
set
in
a
very


remarkable
frame
of
superbly
carved
oak

part
of
the
woodwork
of
the


demolished
church
of
st

gery

of
historical
interest

too

is
a
large


van
der
meulen

representing
the
defeat
of
turenne
before
valenciennes


in


by
the
spanish
army
under
conde

from
a
bird
s
eye
view
of


valenciennes
in
the
background
of
this
large
canvas

we
may
see
how
much


the
city
has
lost
by
the
gradual
destruction
of
its
finest
architectural


features






within
the
last
few
years
the
museum
of
valenciennes
has
been
endowed



through
the
munificence
chiefly
of
a
wallachian
nobleman

prince
george


stirbey

well
known
in
paris

with
a
unique
collection
of
the
works
of


carpeaux

the
sculptor
of
the
famous
groups
which
adorn
the
facade
of


the
grand
opera
house
at
paris






carpeaux
was
born
at
valenciennes

and
the
fine
statue
of
watteau
which


stands
now
in
the
city
was
both
suggested
and
executed
by
him

so
long


ago
as


when
he
began
to
recognise
his
own
place
in
contemporary


art

he
expressed
his
wish
to
have
his
memory
perpetuated
in
his
native


place
by
as
complete
a
collection
of
his
works
as
could
be
made

and
in


his
will

drawn
up
in


he
left
to
valenciennes
all
his
models
in


plaster

and
all
the
drawings
for
his
works

together
with
all
the


sketch
books
he
had
filled
during
his
artistic
life

and
which
were
then


in
the
keeping
of
his
relations
at
auteuil






in
process
of
time
carpeaux
found
it
necessary
to
part
with
a
great
many


of
his
drawings

and
prince
george
stirbey

who
had
bought
most
of
them



after
the
death
of
the
artist

divided
them
into
three
lots

one
of


which
he
gave
to
the
louvre

another
to
the
school
of
fine
arts
at


paris

and
the
third
and
richest
to
valenciennes

to
this
princely


liberality

valenciennes
is
indebted
for
the
singular
fulness
and
value


of
the
carpeaux
collection
which
it
now
possesses






among
the
portraits
in
the
museum
proper

is
one
which
ought
to
be
sent


to
the
musee
de
la
revolution
in
paris

it
is
a
pastel
of
a
typical


revolutionary
personage

who
bore
the
not
very
attractive
name
of


charles
cochon

he
was
one
of
the

patriots

of


and
having
vowed


irreconcilable
hatred
to
all
kings
and
emperors

he
was
selected
to
go


as
a
commissary
to
the
army
of
the
north
after
dumouriez
had
delivered


up
camus
and
his
companions
with
beurnonville
to
the
austrians

after


the
advent
of
napoleon

this
incorruptible
republican
became
one
of
the


most
serviceable
servants
of
the
new
master
of
france

and
ended
his


career
as
an
imperial
senator

with
the
queer
title
of
comte
de


lapparent






i
wisely
availed
myself
of
my
first
morning
in
valenciennes
to
visit


these
collections
in
the
hotel
de
ville

for
in
the
afternoon
m

guary



the
son
of
the
distinguished
director
of
the
great
coal
mines
of
anzin



which
i
especially
desired
to
see

kindly
drove
into
my
comfortable
old


hotel
and
most
hospitably
insisted
on
carrying
me
off
to
the
mines






at
the
beginning
of
the
last
century
there
was
but
a
single
house
in
all


the
territory
now
known
as
the
commune
of
anzin

it
is
now
the
seat
of


a
busy
and
growing
town

a
suburb

or

to
speak
more
exactly

an


extension
beyond
the
walls
of
the
city
of
valenciennes

this
town
has


been
called
into
existence
during
the
last
century
and
a
quarter
by
the


operations
of
the
anzin
company

the
largest
coal
mining
company
in


france

the
concessions
held
and
worked
by
this
company
cover
an
area
of




hectares






six
years
ago

when
what
is
known
as
the
great
strike
at
anzin
attracted


to
this
important
region
the
attention
of
all
persons
interested
in
that


question
of
labour

which
the
excellent
m

doumer
tells
us
the

true


republic

has
been

studying

in
vain
for
ten
years

the
anzin
company


employed


workmen

of
whom


were
at
work
on
the
surface
and




were
employed
on
the
subterranean
work
of
the
mines

the
coal


extracted

which
had
reached



tons
in


amounted
in

to





tons

being
one
tenth
part
of
all
the
coal
production
of


france

the
coal
mining
of
anzin
is
carried
on
now
in
the
face
of
a


great
and
increasing
competition
almost
at
its
very
doors

to
the
north


and
east
lie
the
great
coal
fields
of
belgium

which
in

sent
into


france



tons
of
coal

and
in





tons

on
the
north


and
west
lie
the
great
french
coal
fields
of
the
pas
de
calais

where



at
lens
and
other
points

great
discontent
has
shown
itself
during
the


current
year
among
the
miners

but
which
increased
their
output
from





tons
in

to



tons
in


then

beyond
the


channel

england

which
had
sent
into
france

in





tons
of


coal

in

sent
in



tons

and

finally

from
germany
in



france
took



tons
against



tons

these
figures
will


suffice
to
show
the
importance
of
anzin
as
a
coal
field

it
draws
its


prosperity
from
roots
struck
deep
into
the
soil
nearly
a
century
and
a


half
ago

and
long
before
the
traditional
institutions
of
france
were


thrown
into
the
melting
pot

amid
the
cheers
of
a
mob
in
the
streets

by


another
mob
which
called
itself
a
national
assembly






at
the
beginning
of
the
last
century

when

as
i
have
said

there
was


but
a
single
house
in
all
the
present
territory
of
anzin

coal
was
not


known
to
exist
in
this
part
of
france

in
the
low
countries

then


austrian

and
just
beyond
the
french
frontier

coal
was
mined

and
it


came
into
the
head
of
an
energetic
dweller
in
the
little
town
of
conde


that
what
was
found
in
hainault
might
be
found
also
in
french
flanders



his
name
was
desambois

and
he
was
not
a
rich
man

but
he
succeeded
in


getting
from
louis
xv

a
concession
in

authorising
him
to
seek
for


coal
within
a
considerable
range
of
territory
till


the
crown
even


gave
him
a
small
subsidy

but
the
mississippi
bubble
burst
while
he
was


struggling
with
the
difficulties
which
surrounded
him
when
he
first


struck
certain
imperfect
veins
of
coal

and
in
the
stress
of
that
great


crash
he
found
himself
obliged
to
part
with
his
rights
for
the
sum
of




florins
to
two
gentlemen
of
the

noblesse


though
not
of
the


great

noblesse


the
vicomte
desandrouin
de
noelles

and
m

taffin



there
is
a
portrait
in
the
musee
at
valenciennes
of
m

desandrouin
which


shows
the
qualities
one
would
expect
to
find
in
a
man
who
so
long
ago


and
in
such
circumstances
undertook
such
an
enterprise
with
a
limit
of


no
more
than
eighteen
years
before
him

these
two
connected
with


themselves
a
brother
of
desandrouin

a

gentleman
glassworker

at


fresnes

and
two
brothers
named
pierre
and
christophe
mathieu

they


worked
on

undiscouraged
but
unsuccessful

for
twelve
years

until



finally

on
june




pierre
mathieu

who
was
a
trained
engineer



found
at
anzin
the
long
sought
vein
of
bituminous
coal






this
auspicious
day
is
commemorated
on
the
simple
slab
which
marks
the


burial
place
of
mathieu
in
the
communal
church
of
anzin

when
one


considers
what
the
discovery
meant

and
what
its
results
now
mean

to


the
welfare
and
the
prosperity
of
france

one
is
tempted
to
regard
the


th
of
june
as
a
date
almost
as
well
worth
celebrating
by
frenchmen
as


the
th
of
july






marshal
villars
is
celebrated
by
a
very
uncomely
obelisk
on
his


battle
field
of
denain
near
by

and
general
de
dampierre
by
a
column
in


the
public
square
of
anzin
itself

why
should
not
anzin
set
up
a
statue


of
pierre
mathieu






a
comparatively
short
time
sufficed
to
convince
the
adventurous


associates
that
they
had
indeed
found
the
great
veins
they
had
sought



pierre
taffin
went
to
paris
and
got
a
considerable
extension
from
the


crown
of
their
concession

money
was
raised
and
the
work
went
on



bringing
labourers
and
settlers
to
anzin
and
founding
the
new
industry



then
came
a
new
danger

which
might
have
been
foreseen

the
lords
of
the


soil
at
anzin
had
been
quite
left
out
of
the
calculation

but
the
lords


of
the
soil
at
anzin
in

were
quite
as
well
awake
to
their
legal


rights

and
to
the
advantages
to
be
derived
from
a
judicious
use
of


these
rights

as
were
the
small
farmers
of
pennsylvania
long
afterwards



when
prospecting
engineers
began
to
sink
shafts
and
to
pump
up
oil
along


the
slopes
of
the
appalachians

the
prince
de
croy
solre
and
the
marquis


de
cernay
brought
forward
their
title
to
share
in
the
riches
found


beneath
their
acres

desandrouin
and
his
associates
contested
these


claims
as
long
as
they
could

but
the
contests
ended

as
the
lawyers
had


seen
from
the
first
that
it
must

in
a
compromise

the
prince
and
the


marquis
on
the
one
hand
with
their
titles
to
the
land

and
the
vicomte


and
his
associates
on
the
other
with
their
royal
concessions

came


together

and
in

founded
the
anzin
company






as
in
the
case
of
st

gobain

the
capital
of
the
company
was
divided


into
sols
and
deniers

there
were
twenty
four
deniers

of
which
the


prince
de
croy
solre
received
four
for
himself
and
two
associates

the


vicomte
desandrouin
five
sols
and
four
deniers

the
heirs
of
m

taffin


three
sols
nine
deniers

the
marquis
de
cernay
and
his
six
associates


eight
sols

and
the
engineer
mathieu
six
deniers

the
phraseology
of
the


articles
of
association
is
somewhat
quaint
and
ancient

but
the
spirit


of
them
is
essentially
fair
and
equitable

the
recital
of
the
objects


for
which
the
company
was
formed
is
a
model
in
its
way

and
shows
that


the
authors
of
these
articles

nobles

roturiers

engineers

and


notaries
of
the

ancien
regime

in


had
nothing
to
learn
from


jean
jacques
rousseau
or
the
abbe
sieyes
as
to
the
essential
rights
and


duties
of
men
in
a
civilised
community

thus
it
runs









to
bring
about
a
general
union
of
the
coal
pits
in
the
territory
of


fresnes

anzin

old
conde

raismes

and
st

vaast

put
an
end
to
all
the


differences
and
proceedings
brought
before
the
council
and
as
yet


unsettled

make
it
possible
to
live
in
good
union
and
a
good


understanding

and
secure
the
interests
of
the
state
and
of
the
public


by
forming
solid
establishments

there
are
adopted
by
this
present
act



which
shall
be
duly
ratified
before
a
notary

the
following
articles







these
articles
are
nineteen
in
number

and

as
in
the
case
of


st

gobain

one
article
binds
the
associates
always
to
furnish

in


proportion
to
their
shares

whatever
funds
may
be
required
for
the


enterprise






the
hereditary
principle
is
distinctly
recognised
in
these
articles
not


only
as
to
the
ownership
of
the
shares

but
as
to
the
management

and


the
prince
de
croy
solre
and
the
marquis
de
cernay

with
their


successors

are
accorded
certain
rights
as
arbitrators

and
in
the


election
of
directors

a
circumstance
worth
noting
because
i
find
that



notwithstanding
the
supposed
abolition
by
the
revolutionists
of

of


the
hereditary
principle

and
of
titles
of
nobility
and
of
privileges



these
articles
of
association

just
as
they
stood
when
they
were
signed


and
subscribed
on
november




were
quietly
recognised
and


registered

and
a
good
fee
taken
for
the
recognition
and
the


registration
by
the
proper
republican
functionary
at
paris

on
the




pluviose

an

of
the
republic
one
and
indivisible






the
main
street
of
anzin

through
which
m

guary
drove
me
to
the
offices


of
the
company

is
a
broad
and
well
paved
highway

with
many


shade
trees

and
the
houses

for
the
main
part

well
built

though
not


particularly
picturesque

m

guary
tells
me
there
are
a
good
many
small



rentiers

living
here

which
seems
to
show
that
the
place
must
be


orderly
and
quiet

many
of
the
houses
are
brightly
painted

in
blue



green

pink

and
other
colours
not
to
be
expected

and
of
cabarets
the


name
is
legion

m

baudrillart
pronounces
intemperance
to
be
a


characteristic
foible
of
the
flemish
french

or
french
flemings

but
in


these
cabarets

which
were

so
far
as
i
saw

rather
exceptionally
neat


and
even
handsome

the
customers
seemed
to
be
taking
light
beer
and


certain
sweet
beverages

rather
than
spirits






at
the
main
office
i
found
m

de
forcade

a
son
of
the
celebrated


minister
of
napoleon
iii


to
whom
when
he
retired

on
the
accession
to


power
of
m

emile
ollivier

the
emperor
addressed
a
remarkable
letter



recognising

in
the
strongest
terms
that
could
be
used

his
abilities



his
integrity

and
his
patriotism

m

de
forcade
had
just
received
a


telegram
from
the
father
of
m

guary

at
paris

announcing
his
arrival


at
anzin
for
the
next
day

and
asking
me
to
prolong
my
visit

which
i


was
very
glad
to
do






there
are
many
factories
at
work
in
and
around
anzin

but
there
is


nothing
plutonian
in
the
aspect
of
the
place
or
of
the
neighbourhood



and
the
grimy
side
of
coal
mining
nowhere
obtrudes
itself

on
the


contrary
the
green
fields

under
a
very
high
cultivation

everywhere


encroach
agreeably
upon
the
town

the
residence
of
m

guary

the


director

stands
in
an
exceedingly
pretty
park

and
the
mansion

a


handsome
modern
chateau

is
surrounded
with
fine
and
well
grown
trees



you
approach
the
mansion
from
the
busy
main
streets
of
anzin

traversed


by
a
tramway
leading
to
denain

but
from
its
windows
and
balconies
which


overlook
the
park

you
gaze
out
upon
the
verdure
and
the
spacious
peace


of
a
wide
rural
landscape






a
certain
proportion
of
the
workmen
employed
in
the
mines
prefer
to
live


in
the
town

but
it
is
the
policy
of
the
company
to
encourage
the


development
of
cottage
life

and
wherever
i
went
throughout
its


extensive
domain
i
found
families
of
the
workmen
installed
in


comfortable
homes

surrounded
by
gardens
and
by
what
are
called
in


england

allotments


of
these
the
company
now
owns
no
fewer
than





originally
these
houses
were
built
in
the
form
of

cites
ouvrieres


but


it
has
been
found
by
experience
that
these
blocks
of
contiguous
houses


are
open
to
certain
objections
from
the
point
of
view
of
health

as
well


as
from
the
point
of
view
of
morals

and
the
more
recent
constructions


are
detached
cottages

a
model
of
one
of
these
cottages
was
exhibited
in


the
social
economy
section
of
the
exposition
at
paris
this
year

but
it


was
more
satisfactory
to
see
them
actually
inhabited
and
on
the
spot



each
cottage
is
built
in
a
field
of
land
of
two
acres
in
extent

and
the


rent
varies
from
three
francs
and
a
half
to
six
francs
a
month

for
the


lesser
sum

or
for
forty
two
francs
a
year

a
workman
at
anzin
earning


an
average
wage
of
three
francs
a
day

or
in
round
numbers
a
thousand


francs
a
year

may
thus
secure
a
well
built
house

most
of
those
i
saw


were
of
brick

with
proper
drainage
and
cellarage

containing
two
good


rooms
on
each
of
three
floors

with
closets

and
standing
in
its
own


grounds






compare
this

not
with
the
squalid
and
noisome
single
rooms
for
which
in


the
worst
parts
of
spitalfields
a
rent
of
tenpence
a
day

or
five


shillings
a
week

sunday
being
thrown
in
free
when
the
weekly
rent
is


duly
paid


or
thirteen
pounds
sterling
a
year
is
exacted

but
with
the


average
rental
of
lodgings
in
the
manufacturing
towns
of
massachusetts






but
this
is
not
all

whatever
repairs
are
needed
in
these
houses
are


made

not
by
the
tenants

but
by
the
company

and
the
company
further


leases
to
its
workmen

who
choose
to
avail
themselves
of
them

at
very


low
rates
garden
sites
within
each
commune

for
cultivation
as


kitchen
gardens

no
fewer
than


families
now
have
such
holdings


under
cultivation

making
a
total
of

hectares
thus
put
to
profit
by


the
workmen

who
take
a
lively
pleasure
in
cultivating
them
during
their


leisure
hours






every
workman
is
allowed
furthermore
by
the
company
seven
hectolitres
of


ordinary
coal
per
month
for
his
own
use

in
cases
of
illness

or
where
a


workman
has
a
family
of
more
than
six
persons

this
allowance
is


increased

in

the
coal
thus
given
by
the
company
amounted
to




quintals

representing
a
money
value
of


francs

this
is


not
only
a
practical
application
of
the
scriptural
injunction

not
to


muzzle
the
ox
which
treadeth
out
the
grain


it
is
a
practical


contribution
to
the
solution
of
the
great

question

which
m

doumer
in


his
report
tells
us
the

true
republic

has
been
for
ten
years
making


believe
to
study

of
the
participation
of
the
workman
in
the
profits
of


the
work

it
is

indeed

from
this
economical
and
practical
point
of


view

and
not
from
the
philanthropic
point
of
view

it
seems
to
me

that


all
these
advantages
conceded
by
the
anzin
company
to
its
workmen
should


be
considered






no
man
of
common
sense
needs
to
be
told
that
to
deal
successfully
with


industrial
enterprises
which
require
the
investment
of
a
large
capital


for
the
production
of
commodities
liable
to
great
fluctuations
in
price



the
managers
of
such
enterprises
must
be
executive
men
employing


executive
methods

if
all
the
workmen
employed
in
such
enterprises
are


to
be
admitted
in
the
ordinary
way
to
a
participation
in
the
profits



they
must
obviously
be
admitted
to
a
participation
in
the
councils

and


in
the
direction
of
the
policy
of
the
managers

how
is
that
to
be


brought
about
without
endangering
the
success
of
the
enterprises

to


consult
the
workmen
of
the
company
on
technical
questions
within
the


range
of
their
regular
employment
is
one
thing

to
consider
the


commercial
and
fiscal
policy
of
the
company
in
its
relation
with


competing
companies

and
with
the
consuming
public

in
a
general


conclave
of
all
the
establishment

would
be
quite
another
thing

it
is
a


curious
fact
that
in
the
original
statutes
of

the
founders
of
anzin


expressly
provided
that
the
six
directors
of
the
company
should

when


necessary

consult
not
only
the
employes

but
the
workmen
of
the


company

the


ouvriers



and
this
provision
was
insisted
on
at
a
time


when

as
the
doctrinaires
of
the
nineteenth
century
would
have
us


believe


labour

was
not
recognised
in
france
as
a
social
force
to
be


considered






under
its
existing
system
of
management
the
anzin
company
makes
its


workmen
real
participants
in
the
profits
of
its
operations

without
at


the
same
time
exposing
them
to
participate
in
the
losses






this
is
done
not
only
through
the
singularly
low
rates
at
which
the


workmen
are
enabled
to
house
themselves
and
their
families

through
the


coal
allowance

through
the
provision
of
cheap
kitchen
gardens

and


particularly
through
the
establishment
of
a
pension
fund
and
of
a


savings
bank

but
in
many
other
forms






advances
repayable
without
interest

for
example

are
made
to
workmen


who
wish
to
buy
or
to
build
houses
for
themselves

these
advances
in



stood
in
the
books
of
the
company
at
a
total
of



francs



of
which



fr


c

had
been
repaid

leaving
a
balance
due
to


the
company
then
of


fr


c

with
these
funds
workmen
of
the


company
had
bought
or
built
for
themselves

houses

being
thus


visibly

and
unanswerably
to
the
extent
of
the
value
of
these
houses



participants
in
the
profits
of
anzin






not
less
real
is
the
participation
of
the
workmen
in
the
profits
through


the
various
beneficial
and
educational
institutions
which
i
visited
with


m

guary

or
with
his
son

and
of
which
i
shall
presently
speak






the
concessions
now
possessed
by
the
anzin
company
are
eight
in
number



those
of
vieux
conde

fresnes

raismes

anzin

saint
saulve

denain



odomez

and
hasnon

these
concessions
cover

in
the
form
of
an
irregular


polygon

about
thirty
continuous
kilometres
of
territory

stretching


from
somain
to
the
belgian
frontier

with
a
breadth
varying
from
seven


to
twelve
kilometres

the
total
area
amounts
to



hectares






of
these
concessions
the
four
first
named
were
the
original
basis
of
the


organisation
of
the
company
under
the
controlling
influence
of
the


prince
de
croy
solre
at
the
chateau
of
l
hermitage
which
still
belongs


to
his
family
near
conde






the
others
have
been
acquired
since


hasnon

the
latest

which


covers
about


hectares

in







but

and
this
is
a
notable
fact

the
anzin
company
from
the
beginning
to


this
day
has
been
organised
and
managed
under
the
original
statutes
of




under
these
statutes

devised
and
drawn
up
absolutely
under
the



ancien
regime


and
by
an
association
of
practical
engineers
and


enterprising
adventurers
with
feudal
seigneurs

this
great
company
has



for
more
than
a
century
and
a
quarter

administered
with
signal
success



and
still
administers

what
may
be
fairly
called
an
industrial
republic



carrying
on
its
affairs
and
developing
its
resources
in
the
face
of
the


enormous
changes
of
modern
life

and
maintaining
here

under
what
are


thought
to
be
the
most
trying
conditions
of
labour

a
most
remarkable


measure
of
harmony
between
an
ever
increasing
nation
of
labourers
and
a


strictly
limited
administration

composed
not
only
of
capitalists

but


of
hereditary
capitalists

what
becomes
of
the
rights
of
man
and
of
the


abbe
sieyes

and
of
the
tiers
etat

which

ought
to
be
everything


and


of
the

immortal
principles
of



in
the
face
of
all
this






to
the
wisdom
of
the
national
assembly
the
workmen
and
the
company
of


anzin
owe
considerably
less
than
nothing

the
national
assembly

of


course

meddled
with
the
mines
of
france

as
it
meddled
with
everything


else

it
did
endless
debating
over
the
subject

in
the
course
of
which


mirabeau
declaimed
eloquently
against
the
doctrine
of
turgot

that
the


mines
belong
to
the
men
who
find
them

a
doctrine
which

after
all

is


much
more
rational
than
the
more
recent
contention
of
sundry
modern


orators
of
the
human
race
that

the
mines
belong
to
the
miners


but


after
it
had
talked
itself
hoarse

the
assembly
had
to
descend
to
the


prosaic
business
of
legislation

and
in
dealing
with
the
mines

as
in


dealing
with
other
matters

it
made
a
muddle
of
the
laws
which
existed


before
it
met

and
left
this
muddle
to
be
resolved
into
a
new
order
of


things
legal

under
the
presiding
genius
of
napoleon






under
the

ancien
regime

the
rights
of
the
feudal
lords
of
the
land


over
the
mines
beneath
the
soil
had
been
contested
by
the
steadily


increasing
power
of
the
sovereign

in
the
case
of
the
anzin
company

and


of
the
articles
of
association
adopted
in


we
see
the
practical


good
sense
of
the
practical
men
who
adopted
those
articles
bringing


about
a
good
working
arrangement
between
the
concessions
granted
by
the


crown
and
the
claims
advanced
by
the
lords
of
the
land

the
republican


legislators
in

concocted
a
mining
law

under
which
the
dominion
of


the
sovereign

taken
over
by
the
state

was
brought
into
perpetual


conflict
with
the
recognised

but
undefined

rights
of
the
lords
of
the


soil

such
was
the
mischief
caused
by
this
ill
digested
law
that

in




napoleon
made
an
end
of
it

and
substituted
for
it
an
imperial


law

under
which
the
absolute
ownership
of
mines
in
france
might
be


conferred
by
a
concession
of
the
government


the
act
of
concession




says
the
seventh
article
of
the
law


gives
a
perpetual
ownership
of
the


mine

which
from
that
moment
may
be
disposed
of
and
transmitted
like
any


other
kind
of
property

and
no
holder
of
it
can
be
expropriated

except


in
the
cases
and
under
the
forms
prescribed
with

regard
to
all
other


properties


this
law
of
course
made
an
end
both
of
the
royalties
of


the
old
french
system

and
of
the
english
and
american
doctrine
that
he


who
owns
the
land
owns
up
to
the
sky
and
down
to
the
centre
of
the


earth

for
while
the
state
recognises
under
this
law
the
owner
of
the


surface

and
provides
that
the
state
shall
give
him
what
may
be
called
a


kind
of

compensation
for
disturbance

though
on
a
scale
to
be
fixed
by


itself

it
recognises
in
him
no
ownership
whatever
of
the
mine
beneath


his
soil






nor
does
it
recognise
under
this
law
any
right
in
the
discoverer
of
a


mine
to
a
proprietary
interest
in
a
property
which
but
for
him
might


never
have
existed
as
an
available
property
at
all

either
for
the
owner


of
the
surface

or
for
the
state

or
for
the
concessionary
of
the
state



the
founders
of
the
anzin
company
in


it
will
be
seen

recognised


the
right
of
pierre
mathieu

the
discoverer
of
bituminous
coal
at
anzin



to
such
a
proprietary
interest
in
the
mine
he
had
discovered

but
they


recognised
it
with
a
practical
and
sensible
reference
to
the
concurrent


rights
also
of
other
people

and
to
the
general
utility

so
much
more


deftly

it
would
appear

were
practical
questions

involving
the


interests
of
labour
and
of
capital

handled
under
the

ancien
regime

by


practical
persons

whether
nobles

engineers

or
adventurers

who
had
a


practical
interest
in
settling
them
wisely

than
by
theoretical
persons




philosophers
and
patriots


whose
only
practical
interest
lay
in



unsettling

them

during
the
long
legislative
riot
which
began
in







the
influence
of
this
period
upon
labour
and
capital
in
france
is
well


illustrated
in
the
records
of
this
company
at
anzin






in


when
poor
coal


charbon
maigre


was
first
found
by
the


vicomte
desandrouin
and
his
friends
at
fresnes

fifty
five
tons
of
the


mineral
were
extracted

in


pierre
mathieu

struck
it
rich

at


anzin

and
work
began
in
earnest

by

the
yearly
output
reached




tons

in


when
the
company
of
anzin
was
finally
formed

and


the
articles
of
association
were
signed

the
output
of
the
concessions


worked
by
the
company
amounted
to


tons

from
that
time
it


increased

not

by
leaps
and
bounds


but
steadily

till
in

it
had


reached


tons

in

it
increased
again
to


tons

then


came
a
decline

gradual
at
first

but
as
things
grew
worse
at
paris



sharp
and
sudden

the
output
fell
to


tons
in


fell
again
to




tons
in


with
the
murder
of
the
king

and
the
final
crash


of
law
and
order
throughout
france

in

the
output
dropped
suddenly


to


tons

or
less
by

per
cent

than
it
had
been
in


the


year
before
the
company
was
finally
formed

in
the
next
year



it


dropped
again
to


tons

a
point
below
that
of
the
production
in




four
years
before
the
formation
of
the
company

when
the
lords
of


the
land
were
in
the
thick
of
their
legal
battle
with
the
vicomte


desandrouin
and
the
concessionnaires






things
began
gradually
to
look
better
as
it
became
more
and
more
clear


that
the
republic
could
not
last

and
with
the
establishment
of
the


consulate
and
the
empire
they
grew
better
still

but
it
was
not
till



that
the
output
approached
the
figure
reached
in
the
last
year
of


the
monarchy








with
the
disasters
of

and


of
course

it
fell
again

but


within
two
years
after
the
restoration
of
the
monarchy

in


the


output
reached
and
passed
the
highest
point
attained
before
the


revolution

and
stood
at


tons

in

the
output
had
reached




tons

but
the
revolution
of
that
year
threw
it
back
again

in




to


tons

under
the
monarchy
of
july

the
production


gradually

though
not
regularly

increased
again

until
in

it
had


reached


tons

only
to
be
struck
down
by
the
senseless
revolution


of

to


tons
in


it
went
up
with
the
establishment
of


the
second
empire
in

to


tons
in


and
by

had


reached



tons






under
the
governments
of
m

thiers
and
of
the
marshal
duke
of
magenta



during
which

according
to
m

doumer

the
republic
existed

only
in


name


the
output
went
up
till

in


it
passed
the
two
million


limit

only
to
recede
again
with
the
advent
to
power
of
m

gambetta
and


his
friends

with
their

true
republic


under
which
it
fell
in

to





tons

the
elections
of


marking
the
rise
of
a
great


conservative
and
monarchical
reaction

were
followed

in


by
an


increase
in
the
output
of
the
anzin
mines
to



tons

and
in




when
from
one
end
of
france
to
the
other

the
republic
was


officially
and
almost
hysterically
declared
by
the
authorities
to
be
in


deadly
peril

and
men
were
speculating
as
to
whether
president
carnot



or
general
boulanger

would
open
the
exposition
in


the
anzin


output
reached



tons






of
course

account
must
be
taken
of
other
than
political
considerations


in
estimating
the
significance
of
this
record

nor
do
i
wish
unduly
to


dwell
upon
what
may
be
called
its
barometrical
value
in
the
study
of


contemporaneous
french
history






but
when
we
consider
the
relations
of
coal
to
all
the
great
industries


of
our
time

it
is
certainly
noteworthy
that
for
more
than
a
century


every
development
in
paris
of
a
tendency
favourable
to
republicanism
in


france

should
appear
to
have
been
followed
by
an
unfavourable
effect



and
every
development
unfavourable
to
republicanism
in
france
by
a


favourable
effect
upon
the
production

at
anzin

of
a
mineral
which
has


come
to
be
the

staff
of
life

of
all
modern
industry
and
commerce






for
during
the
whole
of
this
period
anzin
has
been
what
it
still
is

the


coal
capital

as
st

gobain
is
the
glass
capital

and
creuzot
the


iron
capital
of
france

its
mines
produce
about
one
tenth
of
the
total


output
of
french
coal

a
falling
off

therefore

in
the
output
of
the


anzin
mines
may
be
fairly
enough
taken
as
an
indication
of
disease
in


the
body
politic
of
france

the
most
considerable
falling
off
in
this


output
of
late
years
was
in


when
the
production
fell
to






from



in
the
preceding
year



two
of
the
great
french


industries

the
iron
industry
and
the
sugar
industry

both
of
them
most


important
consumers
of
coal

were
then
passing
through
a
period
of


depression

the
over
production
of
sugar
in
germany
having
seriously


damaged
the
french
sugar
producers
in
particular

to
meet
the
pressure


put
upon
them
by
the
decline
in
the
demand
for
coal

the
directors
of


the
anzin
company
found
it
necessary
to
carry
out
certain
economies



either
through
a
reduction
of
wages
or
through
some
modification
in


their
methods
of
production






if
they
had
been
allowed
to
do
this
through
an
undisturbed
arrangement


with
their
workmen

there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
that
it
would
have
been


done
with
little
friction

and
with
no
injustice
to
anyone

wages
at


anzin
had
steadily
risen
from
a
daily
average

for
the
surface
workmen



of

fr


c

to

fr


c

in


concurrently
with
the
development


at
anzin
of
that
system
of
practical
participation
in
the
profits
to


which
i
have
already
alluded

for
the
subterranean
workmen

the
advance


had
been
from

fr


c

in

to

fr


c

in







the
spirit
in
which
the
anzin
company
has
been
administered
from
the


beginning
is
strikingly
illustrated
by
the
steady
advance
in
the
wage
of


the
workmen

in
belgium

one
of
the
chief
seats
of
the
competition
with


anzin
for
the
coal
market
of
france

on
the
contrary

the
wages
of
the


workmen
are
subject
to
the
fluctuations
of
the
general
market

in




for
example

the
average
wage
of
the
workmen
in
the
mines
of
hainault



as
given
to
me
by
m

guary

was

fr


c


or
about

per
cent

above


the
average
wage
of

at
anzin

but

was
the
year
of
the
great


advance
in
coal

in

the
average
hainault
wage
fell
to

fr


c




in

it
fell
to

fr

and
in

it
stood
at

fr


c

by



the
average
wage
at
anzin
had
risen

and
steadily
risen

to

c






during
the
year

the
expenditure
of
the
company
upon
the
assistance


fund

the
pension
fund

the
medical
services

the
gratuitous
supply
of


fuel

the
cottages

in
addition
to

and
not
at
the
expense
of

the
wages


paid

reached
a
total
of



francs

during
this
same
year
the


profits
of
the
company

as
stated
after
an
inquiry
by
the
french


minister
of
public
works

amounted
to



francs

this
really


seems
to
warrant
the
assertion
that
at
anzin
in

the
profits
of
the


mines
were
virtually
divided
into
two
equal
portions

one
of
which
went


to
capital
and
the
other
to
labour

assuming
this
assertion
to
be

even


roughly
speaking

accurate

why
should
there
have
been
any
serious


collision
between
capital
and
labour

in
such
an
organisation

over
a


question
of
practical
economies
necessarily
advantageous
to
both






yet
there
was
such
a
collision

in
february


what
is
known
as
the


great
strike
at
anzin
broke
out
over
a
proposed
improvement
in
the


methods
of
working

the
demonstrable
effect
of
which
must
be
to
improve


the
position
of
the
best
workmen
employed
by
the
company

without
doing


real
injustice
to
others

a
similar
strike
had
occurred
a
quarter
of
a


century
before

when
the
company
insisted
on
introducing
from
england


and
belgium
the
use
of
ponies
in
the
subterranean
galleries

but
in



the
conservative
instinct
of
the
workmen

which
predisposes
them
in
all


callings
against
innovations
of
any
kind

was
adroitly
worked
upon
and


influenced
by
the
direct
influence
of
the
politicians
of
the

true


republic

at
paris

a
workman
of
the
company
named
basly

who
had
taken


an
active
part
in
organising
a
syndicate
of
mining
workmen
under
a
law


passed
in

to
favour
such
syndications

put
himself
into


communication
with
the
advanced
radicals
at
paris

constituted
himself


the
champion
of
the
syndicates
of
workmen

and

according
to
the


testimony
given
before
a
parliamentary
committee

fomented
a
formidable


exterior
pressure
upon
the
workmen
at
anzin

to
bring
about
the
strike


which
eventually
took
place

and
in
connection
with
which
m

basly


became
a
conspicuous
figure
in
french
republican
politics

receiving
a


much
larger
wage
as
a
deputy
than
he
had
ever
earned
in
the
mines
at


anzin

where

as
the
books
of
the
company
show

though
by
no
means
an


exceptionally
good
workman

he
earned

in



fr


c


and
in




fr


c

a
day






one
obvious
object
of
the
syndicates
of
workmen
being
to
establish
a


kind
of
despotic
control
over
all
the
workmen
of
any
calling

the


syndicate
of
mining
workmen
at
anzin
set
itself

a
year
before
the


strike

in


to
break
down
what
is
known
at
anzin

and
elsewhere
in


france
also

m

guary
tells
me

as
the
system
of

marchandages







under
this
system
the
company
makes
contracts
with
the
workmen
at
a


fixed
price
for
coal

deliverable
during
several
months

a
good


workman

holding
one
of
these
contracts
and
stimulated
by
it

frequently


gains
from

to

per
cent

more
than
the
average
daily
wage
of
his


class

the
syndicate
wished
to
establish

equality

of
wages

or

in


other
words

to
put
idle
or
inferior
workmen
on
the
same
level
with


industrious
and
superior
workmen






to
this
end

the
leaders
resorted
to
the
methods
usual
in
all
such


cases

of
intimidation
and
actual
violence

workmen
at
anzin
who
had


taken

marchandages

were
attacked
and
beaten

some
of
them
so
severely


as
to
disable
them
for
weeks






at
the
parliamentary
inquiry
which
followed
the
strike
of


such


letters
as
the
following

sent
to
workmen
at
anzin

a
year
before

in




were
produced
and
read
in
evidence














cachaprez











citizen


in
the
name
of
the
syndical
chamber
of
the
miners
of







anzin

thou
art
forewarned
that

if
thou
dost
not
cease
thy








marchandage


as
we
have
informed
lagneaux

thou
wilt
pass

in
the







sight
of
thy
brethren
coal
miners

for
a
traitor
and
a
coward

as







well
as
thy
seven
comrades

who
are
worth
no
more
than
thyself












if
thou
dost
not
what
we
exact
of
thee

be
not
surprised
to
find







thyself
stretched
out
a
bit

and
to
be
laid
up
for
three
weeks

as







well
as
the
good
for
nothings
who
are
working
with
thee















receive
our
great
contempt



















a
group
of
workmen
who
will
caress
thee














one
of
these
days
if
thou
dost
not
give














up
thy
marchandage







letters
like
these

which
would
not
discredit
the
rural
terrorists
of


kerry
and
clare

were
followed

not
only
by
attacks
on
the
obnoxious


workmen

but
by
the
destruction
of
their
flowers
and
vegetables
in
the


gardens
which

as
i
have
stated

they
are
enabled
by
the
company
to


cultivate

as
a
workman
may
go
to
his
work
as
soon
as
he
likes
in
the


morning

the
gates
are
closed
just
before
six
o
clock


they
have
their


afternoons
to
themselves

and
those
of
them
who
have
gardens
i
found


working
there
with
great
evident
satisfaction
at
most
of
the
points


which
i
visited






with
the
outbreak
of
the

strike

in


matters
grew
worse

dynamite


was
then
called
into
play

fusees
were
exploded
under
the
windows
and
in


the
doorways
of
workmen
who
refused
to
be
coerced
into
leaving
their


work

as
nearly
nine
tenths
of
the
workmen
had
gone

or
been
driven



into
the
strike

the
cabarets
in
which
the
region
abounds
were
filled


with
crowds
of
idle
men

radical
speakers
and
managers
hurried
down
to


anzin
from
paris

to
harangue
the
multitude
and
stir
the
people
up
to


mischief

and
the
position
of
the
workmen
who
stood
out
against
an


agitation
which
they
knew
to
be
founded
on
no
grievance
of
theirs

and


which
could
have
no
possible
result
for
them
but
to
injure
the
company



with
the
prosperity
of
which
they
felt
their
own
prosperity
to
be


identified

became
really
dangerous






in
the
thick
of
the
contest
thus
provoked
and
carried
on

it
is


interesting
to
find
m

allain
targe

of
whom
i
have
already
had
occasion


to
speak

in
connection
with
his
conduct
as
minister
of
the
interior


during
the
elections
of


appearing
on
the
parliamentary
committee


of
inquiry

of


into
the
situation
at
anzin

as
a
friend
and


advocate
of
the

syndicate
of
workmen


and
urging
the
anzin
company
to


accept
the
syndicate
and
its
secretary

m

basly

as
an
umpire
between


itself
and
the

strikers


who
had
been
seduced
or
coerced
into



striking

by
this
very
syndicate
and
its
secretary






what
possible
good

either
to
labour
or
to
capital

can
be
rationally


expected

what
possible
harm
to
both
may
not
be
legitimately


feared

from
a
republic
controlled
and
administered
by
such
men






one
curious
and
important
incidental
object
of
the

syndicate
of


workmen


and
of
m

basly
in
promoting
this
strike
of

at
anzin



revealed
itself
to
me
in
the
very
full
report
of
the
parliamentary


inquiry
which
m

guary
was
good
enough
to
put
at
my
service






after
devoting
large
sums
of
money
to
the
various
institutions
and
funds


established
by
it
for
the
benefit
of
the
workmen

the
anzin
company


invited
the
workmen
themselves
to
contribute
to
their
own
savings
and


pension
fund
at
the
rate
of
three
per
cent

of
their
wages

the
expenses


of
management
being
borne

of
course

by
the
company

the

syndicate
of


workmen

and
m

basly
did
not
like
this

they
preferred
that
any


contributions
to
be
made
by
the
workmen
from
their
wages
should
be
made



not
to
a
fund
guaranteed
and
administered
by
the
company

but
to
a
fund


to
be
handled
by
the
syndicate






whereupon
m

basly
wrote

and
caused
to
be
circulated
among
the
workmen



a
letter
signed
by
himself
as
secretary
of
the
syndicate

in
which
he


bade
them
regard
the
proposal
of
the
company
as

a
snare
set
for
their


liberties



to
sign
any
such
agreement
as
the
company
suggests


he


said


will
be
to
sign
your
own
death
warrant
and
that
of
your


children








citizens

your
enemies
see
our
union
established

they
know
that
we
are


on
the
point
of
having
a
pension
fund
solidly
established

under
the


guarantee
of
the
state


which
shall
leave
us
all
free
to
work
whenever


we
like







this
idea
of
a
labour
pension
fund
under
the
guarantee
of
the
state
is


not

i
need
hardly
say

of
m

basly
s
invention

it

trots
through
the


heads

of
all
manner
of
political
adherents
of
m

doumer
s

true


republic


it
was
very
neatly

thrashed
out

in
a
brief
colloquy
which



i
noted
down
one
day
in
paris
between
a
representative
of
the

syndicate


of
jewellers

and
a
deputy

m

thiesse


what
would
you
think


asked
m



thiesse


of
an
obligatory
assessment
on
wages

intended
to
secure

by


the
authority
of
the
state
and
with
perfect
safety

a
certain
pension
to


the
workmen
of
your
corporation







whereunto
the
jeweller

m

favelier

replied


we
prefer
freedom
in
this


respect

as
well
as
from
the
point
of
view
of
our
work







m

thiesse
returned
undismayed
to
the
charge







then
you
would
prefer
to
organise
a
pension
fund
in
your
syndical


chamber

but
if
you
had
not
means
enough
to
ensure
pensions
to
your


workmen

what
would
you
think
of
an
institution
which
would
ensure
them


a
pension
and
bread
for
their
old
age







to
which
m

favelier

suddenly
striking
the
bull
s
eye
and

ringing
the


bell



we
do
not
want
the
state
called
in

to
lay
new
taxes
upon
us







m

basly

who
is
probably
a
consumer
rather
than
a
payer
of
taxes

had


more

advanced

views
than
the
parisian
jeweller

but
his
chief


immediate
object
evidently
was
to
secure
contributions
from
the
wages
of


the
anzin
workmen
to
a
fund
to
be
controlled
by
the
syndicate

what
the


eventual
meaning
to
the
contributing
workmen
of
a
fund
so
controlled
is


likely
to
be
may
be
inferred
from
an
incident
which
came
to
my
knowledge


not
long
ago

in
london

a
question
arose
between
a
certain
association


of
english
engineers

and
men
employed
by
one
of
the
great
english


railway
companies

over
an
issue
not
unlike
that
presented
at
anzin
by


the
demand
of
the

syndicate
of
miners


that
the
anzin
workmen
should


give
up
their
long
time
and
profitable
contracts

the
men
in
the


employment
of
the
railway
were
old
and
excellent
railway
men

who
were


earning

on
a
kind
of
special
contract

something
like
a
pound
a
week


apiece
more
than
the
usual
rates
paid
to
their
class

they
were
members


of
the
association
referred
to

and

as
such

had
for
many
years


contributed
to
its
funds
under
a
system
which
promised
them
a
certain


pension
at
the
expiration
of
a
certain
number
of
years

this
being
the


situation

these
men
were
notified
by
the
association
that
if
they
did


not
give
up
their
special
contracts
and
content
themselves
with
the


usual
wages
earned
by
others
of
their
class

they
would

in
the
first


instance

be
fined

out
of
their
own
money
in
the
hands
of
the


association

a
pound
a
week
for
a
given
time

at
the
end
of
which

if


they
still
remained
in
disobedience

their
pensions
would
be
forfeited






i
should
be
glad
to
know
what

employer

ever
devised
a
more
shameless


plan
than
this
for
reducing
workmen
to
slavery

moral
and
financial



probably
the
laws
of
england

if
called
upon

would
protect
them
against


such
outrages

but
how
is
a
workman
in
such
circumstances
to
call
upon


the
laws

how
is
he
to
meet
the
legal
cost
of
defending
his
rights

how


is
he
to
face
the
organised
hostility
of
men
of
his
own
class






the

strike

at
anzin
in

ended
as

strikes

are
apt
to
do

a


certain
proportion
of
the
men
who
had
been
foremost
in
accepting
or


promoting
it
disappeared
from
the
service
of
the
company

others

and


the
majority

escaped
from
the
domination
of
the

syndicate

and
of
m



basly

that
the
conduct
of
the
company
throughout
the
crisis
was
such
as


to
commend
itself
to
the
workmen
in
general
may

i
think

be
inferred


from
the
fact
that
a
fresh
attempt
to
bring
about
a

strike

at
anzin



since
i
visited
the
place

completely
failed

the
attempt
originated


with
the
leaders
of
a

strike

which
was
actually
carried
out
in
the


mines
of
the
adjoining
department
of
the
pas
de
calais

the
means


employed
in

to
intimidate
the
workmen
at
anzin
were
again
used

the


troops
and
the
gendarmerie
were

however

called
out
at
anzin

not
to


protect
capital
against
labour

but
to
protect
the
working
men
of
anzin


who
chose
to
keep
out
of
the

strike


against
men
of
their
own
class


who
tried
to
drive
them
into
it

in
this
case
the
original

strike



seems
to
have
been
provoked
by
local
rather
than
general
causes

the


managers
of
the
mines
in
the
pas
de
calais
had
resolved
to
increase
the


output
of
their
mines

this
necessitated
a
considerable
increase
in
the


number
of
miners
employed

and
this
augmented
demand
for
mining
labour



not
unnaturally

led
the
men
to
demand
an
advance
on
their
wages

they


were
encouraged
to
demand
this
advance

too

by
a
somewhat
sudden
rise


in
the
market
price
of
certain
descriptions
of
coal

and
it
is
not


perhaps
surprising
that
it
should
not
have
occurred
to
them
to
ask


themselves
whether
the
rise
in
the
market
price
did

or
did
not

mean
a


real
increase
of
profits
to
their
employers

who

of
course

could
only


take
a
very
partial
advantage
of
the
advance

on
account
of
the
long


contracts
under
which
by
far
the
greater
part
of
their
output
had
to
be


delivered
to
their
customers






i
drove
with
the
younger
m

guary
through
a
charming
bit
of
woodland


country

to
visit
a
newly
opened
pit

the
lagrange
pit

part
of
the
way


led
us
through
a
large
forest
full
of
fine

well
grown
trees

the


shooting
in
this
forest
is
good

chiefly
deer
and
pheasants

it
belongs


to
the
domain
of
the
state

and
is
leased
to
a
former
director
of
anzin



that
the
country
is
a
pleasant
land
to
live
in
appears
from
such
facts


as
this

as
well
as
from
the
blue

yellow

russet
and
rose
pink
houses


which
enliven
the
long
highway
from
valenciennes

and
are
the


habitations
of
well
to
do
people
living
here
on
their
incomes

from


valenciennes
to
the
belgian
frontier

indeed

the
road
is
virtually
one


long
continuous
street
of
houses
and
gardens

as
the
railway
is
between


new
york
and
philadelphia






m

guary
pointed
out
to
me
the
house
of
another
ex
director
of
anzin
who


has
invested
in
a
considerable
tract
of
land
here

on
which
he
has
put


up
a
number
of
exceedingly
neat
houses

they
are
built
of
brick

like


the
small
houses
to
which
the
working
men
of
philadelphia
are
indebted


to
the
philanthropic
enterprise
of
mr

drexel
and
mr

childs

but
i


think
it
would
astonish
mr

drexel
and
mr

childs
to
know
that
a
brick


house

containing
four
good

upright

rooms
and
two
good
garret
rooms



all
wainscoted
in
hard
wood
and
well
fitted
up

well
drained

and
with
a


large
cellar
and
a
garden
rather
wider
than
the
house

running
back
for


several
hundred
yards
to
a
fringe
of
picturesque
forest

can
be
rented


here

from
this
private
proprietor

for

francs

or


a
year






at
an
average
wage
of

fr


c

a
day

working

days
in
the
month



an
average
workman
at
anzin
may
easily
earn


francs
a
year

so
that


he
may
rent
such
a
house
as
i
have
here
described
for
a
good
deal
less


than
one
tenth
of
his
income

what
is
the
ordinary
proportion
between


the
house
rent
and
the
income
of
a
respectable
tradesman
or
mechanic
in


new
york

but
the
anzin
workman
who
rents
such
a
house
as
this
on
such


terms

enjoys
also
free
fuel

free
medical
attendance

and
schooling
for


his
children






we
called
at
one
of
these
private
houses

seeing
the
miner

whom
m



guary
knew
very
well

standing
at
ease
in
his
doorway
and
surveying
the


scene
with
a
pipe
in
his
mouth

he
was
a
shrewd

stalwart
man
of
about


forty

who
glanced
down
complacently
at
his
own
well
developed
limbs
and


laughed
scornfully
when
i
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
a
proposition
i


had
seen
made
at
paris

by
a
friend
of
the
workmen

that
forty
should
be


fixed
as
the
age
of
retiring
pensions
for
miners


he
may
be
a
friend




said
the
miner


but
certainly
he
is
not
a
miner







this
miner
had
long
done
his
day
s
work
in
the
mine

and
after
his
pipe


was
going
to
work
in
his
garden

where
his
vegetables
were
coming


forward
very
well

nothing
could
have
been
better
than
his


manners

quiet

manly

civil

without
the
rather
aggravating
slyness
of


the
ordinary
french
peasant

and
with
absolutely
nothing
of
the


infantine
swagger
of
the
small
french

bourgeois


these
miners
here


wear
a
picturesque
and
practical
costume

something
between
the
garb
of


a
sailor
and
the
garb
of
a
fireman

and
as
their
life

like
the
life
of


a
fireman
or
a
sailor

is
lived
a
good
deal
apart
from
the
lives
of


other
men

and
has
a
constant
spice
in
it
of
possible
danger

they


acquire
a
certain
self
reliance
and
self
possession
which
give
them
a


natural
ease
and
even
dignity
of
carriage

in
talking
with
more
than
one


of
them
i
thought
i
detected
a
slight
tone
of
contempt
towards
other


workmen
and
especially
towards
the
peasants

such
as
tinges
the
talk
of


a
sailor
about
land
lubbers

m

guary
confirmed
this

and
told
me
that


the
men

especially
of
the
old
mining
stock

certainly
do
regard


themselves
as
rather
better
than
their
neighbours






this
may
have
something
to
do
with
the
conservative
strength
in
this


region

politics
do
not
apparently
run
very
high
among
the
miners



either
here
or
in
the
adjoining
region
of
the
pas
de
calais



valenciennes
covers
three
electoral
districts

and
the
anzin
concessions


extend
into
each
of
these
districts

in
the
second
or
st

amand


district
there
was
rather
a
lively
contest
in
september

between
m



girot

a
republican

and
m

de
carpentier

a
boulangist

the
latter


received


votes

but
the
former
was
elected

with


votes

in


the
first
valenciennes
district
the
outgoing
member

an
imperialist

m



renard

was
re
elected

receiving


votes

against


given
to


his
republican
competitor






in
the
second
district
another
outgoing
member

m

thellier
de


poncheville

a
leading
royalist

was
also
re
elected

receiving




votes

against


given
to
his
republican
opponent

in
both
of
these


cases
it
came
within
my
knowledge
that
the
authorities
of
the
department


made
the
most
open
and
unscrupulous
efforts
to
prevent
the
return
of
the


outgoing
members

both
m

thellier
de
poncheville
and
m

renard



however

sate
on
m

pion
s
committee
on
the
mines

and
the
mining


population
of
the
region
appear
to
have
a
singularly
clear
notion
of
the


difference
between
sense
and
nonsense
in
dealing
with
mining
matters






our
miner

who
hit
the
difference
so
neatly
between

miners

and
the



friends
of
miners


after
a
little
chat
on
the
doorway

asked
us

very


politely

to
walk
in
and
look
at
his
home

it
was
very
neatly
and


adequately
furnished

with
clocks
in
each
of
the
ground
floor
rooms



sundry
framed
mezzotints
hanging
on
the
walls

and
a
goodly
show
of


neatly
kept
crockery

the
wife

looking
older
than
her
husband

but
very


probably
his
junior

cheerily
pointed
out
to
me
the
local
improvement


she
had
made
by
transferring
the
cooking
range
from
the
front
room



looking
on
the
highway

to
the
back
room
looking
into
the
garden


it
is


pleasanter

don
t
you
think


she
said


to
sit
out
of
the
kitchen

and


then

with
the
kitchen
at
the
back

one
can
always
leave
the
door
open



that
is
my
idea


we
assured
her
we
thought
it
an
excellent
idea
and


most
creditable
to
her

a
compliment
which
she
received
with
modest


satisfaction

saying


you
know
the
wife
must
think
of
these
things


to


which
the
husband
good
naturedly
assented

while
the
daughter

a


well
grown
good
looking
girl
of
fourteen

looked
up
from
her
household


duties

much
interested
in
our
visit

the
husband

on
his
part

had


contrived
a
convenient
wine
cellar
under
the
stairway


it
will
not
hold


much
wine

he
said
with
a
smile


but
it
is
too
large
for
all
the
wine
i


drink



ah


said
the
wife
archly


he
likes
cider
much
better







this
miner
was
employed
in
the
new
lagrange
pit

and
though
i
was
much


struck
by
the
neatness
of
his
person
and
apparel

i
was
more
struck
by


the
general
absence
of
anything
like
the
griminess
which
we
commonly


associate
with
mines
and
mining
among
his
fellows

whom
i
found
still
at


work
around
the
pits

m

guary
told
me
that
this
is
a
characteristic


trait
of
the
anzin
miners

in
the
buildings
attached
to
each
pit
there


is
a
large
hall

called
the
miner
s
hall

where
the
men
meet
when
they


go
down
to
and
come
up
from
their
underworld

there
each
man
has
a
box



under
lock
and
key

bearing
his
number

in
which
he
puts
away
his


ordinary
clothes
when
he
dons
his
mining
suit

the
company

i
should


mention
here

provides
every
man
when
he
enters
the
service
with
a


mining
outfit

and
to
this
hall
there
is
attached
a
lavatory
for
the
use


of
the
men

the
hall
is
well
warmed
in
winter

and

being
always
on
an


upper
floor

is
well
aired
and
ventilated
in
summer

from
this
hall
at


the
lagrange
pit
we
walked
into
an
adjoining
room

where
we
found
the


miners
going
down
the
shaft
in
a
great
metallic
basket

while
the
coal


came
up

while
we
stood
there

there
came
up
a
magnificent
lump
of
coal



of
a
very
brilliant
and
even
lustrous
surface

around
which
the


admiring
miners
crowded

this
is
a
new
vein

and
the
coal
found
in
it



m

guary
tells
me

burns
with
an
unusually
clear
and
intense
flame






a
miner
with
whom
i
talked
a
little
had
been
to
see
the
exposition

and


it
was
curious
to
perceive
that
he
had
been
much
more
interested
in
the


anzin
part
of
it
than
in
anything
else

he
spoke
indeed
almost


disrespectfully
of
the
eiffel
tower

and
he
was
entirely
convinced
that


the
workmen
at
anzin
were
much
better
off
than
the
workmen
at
paris

as


to
which
i
am
not
prepared
to
dispute
his
opinion

he
had
not
seen
the


president

which
did
not
appear
to
disturb
him
much

but
he
thought
the


beer
at
the
exposition

very
dear
and
very
bad


the
engines

however



he
frankly
admired

though

everybody
can
see
that
it
is
not
possible
to


make
better
engines
than
are
made
at
anzin







one
curious
thing
he
told
me
of
the
young
miners
who
are
drafted
away


into
the
military
service


when
they
come
back


he
said


some
of
them


at
first
try
other
trades

but
all
that
are
of
any
use
sooner
or
later


come
back
to
the
mine

it
is
of
no
use


he
said
reflectively


for
any


man
to
try
to
be
a
miner
if
he
is
not
trained
as
a
boy


this
is
exactly


jack
tar
s
notion
as
to
sailors






from
the
lagrange
pit
we
drove

still
through
pleasant
woods
and
fresh


green
farming
lands

to
thiers

where
the
company
has
a
large
number
of


working
men
s
houses

together
with
a
considerable
church

a
lay
and
a


religious
school

and
other
institutions






there
we
paid
a
visit
to
a
delightful
little
old
lady

with
a
face

full


of
wrinkled
sweetness
and
humour

which
denner
might
have
painted

she


insisted
upon
showing
us
all
over
her
home

and
a
little
miracle
it
was


of
thrift
and
neatness
and
order

from
the
spotlessly
clean
little


bedrooms
with
the
high
flemish
beds

the
crucifix
hanging
over
the
bed



and
prints

not
always
devout

on
the
walls

to
the
sitting
room
with


its
shining
mirror

highly
polished
tin
and
brass
candlesticks
and


platters

and
abundant
china

she
was
a
staunch
imperialist

and
had


portraits
of
the
emperor

with
prints
of
solferino
and
of
sedan


there


it
was
that
they
betrayed
him


said
the
little
old
lady

with
deep


indignation
in
her
voice

i
had
not
the
heart
to
ask
her
who
these


traitors
were

the
garrets
i
found
filled
with
new
mown
hay


it
keeps


there
till
we
sell
it


she
said


and
then
it
smells
so
sweet


which


was
undeniable

behind
her
house

her
son
and
his
wife
were
both
absent


at
their
work

she
showed
us
the
garden

very
trimly
kept
and
gay
with


the
old
familiar
flowers

and
an
arbour

in
which
she
took
especial


pride

none
of
her
neighbours
possessing
anything
of
the
sort






at
thiers
i
talked
with
an
officer
of
the
company
who
had
served
for


some
time
in
one
of
the
great
mines
of
southern
france

the
differences


in
the
habits
and
character
of
the
mining
populations
there
and
here
he


found
very
great

and

on
the
whole

he
evidently
thought
the
northern


miners
much
superior

in
most
essential
points

to
their
fellows
at
the


south

certainly

according
to
him

they
are
neater
in
their
persons



more
cool
and
sensible

less
credulous

less
addicted
to
politics

and


much
more
thrifty


the
women

when
they
are
well
behaved
and
good


managers


he
said


have
more
influence
with
the
men
in
the
north

in


the
south
and
in
auvergne

i
have
sometimes
thought
the
worst
women
had


more
influence
with
the
men
than
the
best







he
had
an
odd
theory
as
to
the
effect
of
great
altitudes
on
human


character


in
auvergne
and
in
savoy


he
said


the
higher
up
you
go


the
more
excitable
and
quarrelsome
you
find
the
people

here
in
flanders


the
people
are
placid

like
the
plains


he
called
my
attention

too

to


the
prevalence
among
the
miners
here
at
anzin
of
a
peculiar
type
of


blonds
with
a
sort
of
ruddy
russet
hair
and
beard

not
quite
the
glowing


titianesque
auburn

and
yet
by
no
means
red

it
is
certainly
a
marked


and
peculiar
tint

and
may
be
seen
faithfully
reproduced
in
a
large


picture
of
the
anzin
miners
exhibited
this
year
at
paris

i
had
supposed


it
to

hark
back

to
the
scandinavians

who
made
themselves
so
much
at


home
in
all
these
fat
and
accessible
regions
after
charlemagne
passed


away







no


said
my
philosophic
engineer


it
is
due
to
the
potash

these


miners
are
so
addicted
to
washing
themselves
and
use
such
quantities
of


strong
soap

that
it
has
permanently
affected
their
hair


upon
which


another
engineer

also
familiar
with
auvergne

broke
in


that
s
all


very
well

but
i
have
seen
many
miners
in
auvergne
with
the
same
tint
of


hair
and
beard

and
you
know
that
there
they
wash
their
faces

at
the


most

once
a
week







this
last
speaker
was
an
exceedingly
shrewd
man
and

as
i
found

a


strong
conservative

he
had
been
asked
to
stand
as
a
candidate
for
mayor


in
his
commune

but
had
declined

though
his
personal
popularity
made


his
election
almost
a
matter
of
form

i
asked
him
why


let
myself
be


elected
to
a
political
office
by
my
workmen


he
said


how
can
a


sensible
man
think
of
such
a
thing

ask
men
to
give
you
their
votes

and


what
authority
will
be
left
to
you

no

i
think
i
know
my
business
too


well
for
that

they
tried
that
sort
of
thing

you
know

during
the
war



and
a
beautiful
business
they
made
of
it

i
suspect
it
was
the
germans


who
suggested
it







what
i
am
told
of
the
morals
of
the
people
here
reminds
me
of
the


traditional
reputation
of
certain
sections
of
pennsylvania
settled
by


the
germans
in
the
last
century

and
of
the
dutch
in
long
island

there


is
a
good
deal
of
drinking


buvettes

are
forbidden
within
the
limits


of
the

cites
ouvrieres


but
in
the
communes
they
are
very
numerous



averaging

i
am
assured

as
many
as
twenty
to
every


inhabitants



to
open
a

buvette

nothing
is
needed
but
a
police
permission

and
the



buvettes

are
kept

for
the
most
part

by
the
wives
of
miners
and
other


artisans

as
a
means
of
adding
to
the
family
income

beer
is
very
cheap



costing
only
two
sous
a
litre

wine
and
spirits
are
more
costly

though


a
great
deal
of
gin
is
made

and
inexpensively
made

in
the
country



there
is
much
sociability
among
the
people

and
great
practical


liberality
as
to
the
conduct
of
young
girls

the
ancient
practice
known


as

bundling

in
new
england
being
still
in
vogue
among
these
worthy


flemings

m

baudrillart

who
evidently
inclines
to
a
favourable


judgment
of
these
northern
populations

puts
the
truth
on
this
point


very
considerately







conspicuous
historical
examples


he
observes


prove
to
me
that
the


flesh
is
weak
in
this
province
of
flanders

the
severity
of
public


opinion
does
not
always
make
up
for
the
laxity
of
the
control
exercised


by
principle

unmarried
mothers
are
numerous

and
incidents
of
this
sort


are
often
regarded
as
simple
errors
of
youth
and
inexperience

to
be


remedied
by
marriage

the
marriage
tie
when
formed

however

is
not
less


respected
than
among
our
rural
populations
in
general

and
cases
of


flagrant
misconduct
on
the
part
of
married
women
are
rare







offences
against
persons
and
property
are
not
relatively
numerous
here



on
the
contrary

while
the
proportion
of
persons
accused
of
crime
is



to
the
hundred
thousand

for
all
france

in
this
department
of
the
nord


it
falls
to



to
the
hundred
thousand

and
this
notwithstanding
the


numbers
crowded
into
the
great
manufacturing
towns
of
the
department

in


the
department
of
the
seine

which
includes
paris

the
proportion
rises


to

to
the
hundred
thousand

and
in
the
agricultural
department
of
the


eure

which
is
the
champion
criminal
department
of
france

to

to
the


hundred
thousand

one
might
almost
imagine
that
m

zola
must
have
gone


to
the
eure
for
his
studies
of
french
peasant
life






without
being
particularly
devout

the
people
of
this
region

i
am
told



are
fond
of
their
religious
observances

and
much
dislike
the


persecution
of
the
church
and
the
laicisation
of
the
schools






at
thiers
the
church

which
is
a
large
one

fronting
on
an
extensive


place
publique

was
very
handsomely
decorated
on
corpus
christi
sunday


by
the
people
of
the
commune

flags
and
garlands
were
put
up

too

all


about
the
place
publique

the
anzin
company
are
now
building
a
large


school
for
girls
very
near
this
church

and
i
visited

with
m

guary



one
afternoon

the
boys

school
at
thiers

it
is
very
well
installed
in


a
large
building

with
a
playground
and
a
gymnasium
roofed
in

but
not


walled

the
teacher

a
lay
teacher

and
a
very
quiet

sensible
man

who


lives
in
the
school
building
with
his
wife

told
me
he
preferred
to
keep


it
thus

and
the
boys
liked
it
better

they
were
at
their
lessons
when
i


visited
the
school

and
a
very
sturdy

comely
lot
of
lads
they
were



some
of
them
were

en
penitence


having
slighted
their
lessons

as
the


teacher
slily
intimated

by
reason
of
the
great
church
festival

this
i


thought
not
unlikely

and
he
did
not
appear
to
regard
it
as
an


absolutely
unpardonable
offence

while
the
juvenile
criminals
themselves


were
evidently
quite
cheery
in
their
minds

in
a
room
near
the


gymnasium
were
racks
filled
with
wooden
guns

these
the
teachers
pointed


out
with
pride

they
were
a
gift
from
the
company
to
his
battalion
of


boys

who
delighted
in
their
regular
military
drill

he
thought
them



after
only
eighteen
months

training

one
of
the
best
boy
battalions
in


the
department

and
would
have
liked
to
take
them
to
paris
to
compete


for
the
athletic
prizes

but
to
take
up
even
a
picked
company
of
ten


would
have
cost

francs

which
he
thought

and
i
agreed
with
him



might
be
better
spent
in
thiers


and
then


he
said
with
a
smile


what


a
life
i
should
have
led
in
paris

with
those
ten
boys
to
look
after







the
anzin
company
used
to
spend


francs
a
year
on
keeping
up
its


own
schools

but
it
is
so
heavily
taxed
for
the

school
palaces

which


have
been
put
up

and
for
the
public
schools

that
it
has
materially


reduced
this
outlay

though
it
still
expends
a
large
sum
in
various
ways


for
the
advantage
of
the
children
of
its
own
workmen
attending
the


public
schools

and
still
keeps
up
certain
religious
schools

especially


for
the
little
children
and
the
girls






one
of
these
schools
for
little
children
which
i
visited
at
st

waast



kept
by
the
sisters

was
a
model

the
little
creatures

ranged
in


categories
according
to
their
years

were
pictures
of
health
and
good


humour

as
they
sate
in
rows
at
their
little
desks

or
marched
about



singing
in
choruses

one
exercise

through
which
a
number
of
them

from


six
to
eight
years
old

were
conducted
by
two
of
the
sisters

might
have


been
studied
from
a
fresco
by
fra
angelico
representing
the
heavenly


choirs

and
gave
the
most
intense
delight
evidently
to
the
singing


children
as
well
as
to
the
smiling
and
kindly
sisters

there
is
a
large


church

too

at
st

waast
and
a

cite
ouvriere







the
commune

i
believe

formerly
was
a
part
of
the
wide
domain
of
the


famous
abbey
of
st

waast
which
grew
up
near
arras
over
the
burial
place


of
st

vadasius

to
whom
after
the
victory
of
clovis
over
the
germans
at


tolbiac
in

the
duty
was
confided
of
teaching
the
frankish
king
his


christian
catechism

he
had
a
tough
pupil

but
he
taught
him

so
well


that
king
clovis
conceived
a
great
affection
for
him

and
got
st

remi


to
make
him
bishop

first
of
arras

and
then
of
cambrai






at
the
time
of
the
revolution
the
great
abbey
near
arras

which
bore
his


name

was
one
of
the
richest
of
the
religious
communities
which



according
to
the
very
important

avis
aux
deputes
des
trois
ordres
de
la


province
d
artois


so
thoroughly
and
instructively
analysed
by
m



baudrillart

held
among
them
in

two
thirds
of
the
land
of
that


province

m

baudrillart
s
analysis
of
this

avis

shows
conclusively


that
a
judicious
and
systematic
overhauling
of
these
ecclesiastical


properties
was
absolutely
necessary

but
it
also
shows
conclusively
that


the
people
of
artois
who
desired
this
wished
to
see
it
done
decently
and


in
order

they
had
a
strong
love
of
their
provincial
independence

even


maximilian
robespierre

who
was
then
bestirring
himself
in
public


matters
at
arras

addressed
his
first
political
publication

which
he


called
a

manifesto


not
to
the
people
of
artois

but
to

the
artesian


nation


this
from
the
future
executioner
of
the
french
federalists
is


sufficiently
edifying
as
to
the
great

national

impulse
to
which
we
are


asked
by
a
certain
school
of
political
rhapsodists
to
attribute
that


outbreak
of
chaos
in
france
called
the

great
french
revolution







what
the
tiers
etat
of
the
great
and
solidly
constituted
province
of


artois
really
wanted
before

is
clearly
set
forth
in
this
remarkable



avis


they
did
not
want
the

rights
of
man


or
the
downfall
of


tyrants

or
any
vague
nonsense
of
that
sort

they
wanted
a
more
fair
and


equitable
system
of
taxation

and
a
better
system
of
agriculture

they


had
some
practical
ideas

too

as
to
how
these
things
could
be
got

for


they
knew
that
these
things
had
been
got
in
england


the
englishman
of


our
times


they
said


gets
an
income
of


pounds
from
a
square


mile
of
land

whereas
the
artesian
can
hardly
get


pounds
from
the


same
area

yet
the
soil
of
artois
is
in
nowise
inferior
to
that
of


england

the
enormous
difference
can
only
be
attributed
to
the


encouragement
and
the
distinctions
which
the
english
government
bestows


upon
agriculture

and
to
the
better
system
of
the
english


administration







this
passage
reads
almost
like
an
extract
from
the
diary
of
arthur


young

and
it
is
noteworthy
that
arthur
young
at
this
same
time

while


he
was
commending
in
his
diary
the
admirable
quality
of
the
deep




level

fertile
plain
of
flanders
and
artois


also
expressed
his


opinion
that

nowhere
in
the
world
was
human
labour
better
rewarded
than


there


taken
together

however

the

avis

and
the
diary
of
arthur


young
prove
that
the
leaders
of
the
tiers
etat
of
artois
in

were


neither
radicals
nor
revolutionists

but
practical
men

who
wished
to


see
the
value
of
their
property
improved

and
the
natural
advantages
of


their
province
more
adequately
developed

to
this
end
they
thought
it


necessary
that
the
constitution
of
the
provincial
estates
should
be


reformed

thanks
to
a
combination

as
the

avis

declares

of
the


municipalities
of
the
towns
with
the

noblesse

and
the
higher
order
of


the
clergy

the

cures



that
most
interesting
class
of
men
who
are


alone
in
a
position
to
make
the
needs
of
the
people
understood
and
to


work
for
their
relief

were
entirely
excluded
from
the
provincial


estates
in


as
were
also
the
farmers

who
alone
can
supply
the


means
of
perfecting
our
agriculture








here


said
the

avis



is
the
true
cause
of
the
prostration
of
our


rural
interests


they
proposed
to
apply
a
remedy
by
recasting
the


representation
in
the
provincial
estates

and
giving

two
deputies
out


of
three
to
the
rural
population







this
having
been
done

so
that
agriculture
might
get
in
artois
the
voice


which
the
author
of
the

avis

believed
it
to
have
in
england

they
then


proposed
a
reconstruction
of
the
system
of
taxation

on
this
point
they


inclined
to
adopt

from
the
south
of
france

the
system
of
paying
the


taxes
not
in
money
but
in
kind

the
system
of
the
tithes

too

needed
a


complete
overhauling

not
with
the
mere
object
of
abolishing
the
tithes



but
in
order
that
the
gross
inequalities
which
the

avis

sets
forth
as


existing

in
regard
to
the
impact
of
the
tithes

both
territorial
and


personal

might
be
done
away
with

and
the
support
of
religion
put
upon


a
sound
basis

this
led
naturally
to
a
demand
for
the
release
of
great


areas
of
valuable
soil
in
artois
from
the
control
of
religious


communities

like
the
abbey
of
st

waast

not
a
few
of
which
were
no


longer
in
a
condition
to
put
these
possessions
to
the
best
uses

either


for
the
church
or
for
the
country

in
artois

as
in
french
flanders

the


extent
of
these
ecclesiastical
domains
which
had
once
been
an
advantage


to
the
people

is
admitted
to
have
become
disadvantageous
to
french


agriculture
with
the
decline
of
the
feudal
aristocracy
and
the
growth
of


the
royal
power

short
leases
only
were
granted
in
general
by
the
church


and
the
monasteries

and
under
these
short
leases
the
farmers
hesitated


to
improve
their
holdings






the
authors
of
the

avis

desire
that
it
may
be
made
possible
to
obtain


leases
of
even
twenty
five
years
which
should
not
be
treated
by
the


treasury
as
an

alienation

of
the
property
leased

with
such
leases



they
say


the
farmer
would
not
hesitate
to
lay
out
money
upon
his
land



because
he
would
feel
sure
of
getting
the
benefit
of
the
outlay

this




they
add


is
one
of
the
principal
means
which
the
english
government


has
employed
in
bringing
agriculture
to
the
state
of
perfection
in
which


we
now
see
it
in
that
monarchy







as
the
greater
part
of
the

cahiers

of
grievances
prepared
by
the


tiers
etat
of
artois
for
the
states
general
of

have
been
lost

this



avis

is
of
great
value

as
setting
before
us
the
real
objects
of
that


order
in
artois

the

cahiers

of
the
artesian

noblesse

and
the
clergy


for
the
states
general
are
all
preserved

and
in
respect
of
the
general


objects
to
be
aimed
at
in
the
states
general

these

cahiers

go
much


farther
than
the

avis


they
seem
to
show
that
in
artois

as
throughout


the
kingdom

the

noblesse

and
the
clergy
were
much
more
enamoured
of


what
are
now
called
the

principles
of


than
were
the
body
of
the


agricultural
population






the

noblesse

and
the
clergy
of
artois
wished
to
see
the
states
general


called
at
regular
intervals

like
the
english
parliament

they
wished


the
provincial
estates
to
be
maintained
and
to
be
convened
annually

and


they
wished
a
provincial
administration
to
be
established
under
a
system


which
should
give
the
tiers
etat
a
representation
equal
to
that
of
both


the
other
orders
united

and
in
which
decisions
should
be
reached
not
by


a
vote
of
the
orders
collectively

but
by
the
members
of
the
whole
body


voting
individually

so
that
a
measure
as
to
which
all
the
members
for


the
tiers
etat
should
be
of
one
mind

might
at
any
time
be
carried
if


they
could
secure
the
adhesion
of
even
a
small
number
of
the
members


from
either
of
the
other
orders

clearly
it
was
not
necessary

in
the


case
of
artois

that
the
tiers
etat
should
be
declared
to
be



everything


in
order
that
justice
might
there
be
done
to
the
wishes


and
the
interests
of
the
tiers
etat

and
if
not
in
the
case
of
artois



why
in
the
case
of
any
other
french
province






the

avis

shows
that
in
artois
before

the
representatives
of
the


tiers
etat
had
confidence
in
the
liberality
and
the
common
sense
of
the



noblesse

and
of
the
clergy

and
that
they
were
disposed
to
consider


all
the
abuses
there
needing
reformation
in
the
spirit
of
practical


compromise
which
had
presided
over
and
made
possible
the
development
of


liberty
and
of
progress
in
holland
and
in
england

but
of
which
no


traces
are
to
be
found
in
the
chaotic
history
of
the

national
assembly



of


the
authors
of
the

avis


for
example

point
out

in
dealing


with
the
questions
of
the
tithes
and
of
the
seignorial
dues
in
artois



that
it
is
the
unequal
and
irregular
impact

above
all

of
those


impositions
to
which
most
of
the
evils
flowing
from
them
must
be


imputed

the
ill
feeling
they
engender
between
the
farmer
and
his


landlord
or
his
pastor

the
bad
blood
they
breed
between
the
different


orders

if
the
charges
of
one
sort
and
another
upon
one
field
of
a


farmer
s
holding
amounted

as
was
sometimes
the
case

to
one
fifth
of


the
value
of
the
crop

while
upon
other
fields
of
his
holding
the


charges
amounted
to
no
more
than
one
thirtieth
of
the
value
of
the
crop



the
farmer
not
unnaturally
gave
his
chief
care
to
the
fields
which
were


least
heavily
encumbered

without
much
troubling
himself
as
to
their


agricultural
merits
relatively
to
the
other
fields






but
while
the
authors
of
the

avis

earnestly
desired
to
see
all
this


changed

and
called
for
the
most
complete
revision
and
re
organisation


of
the
agricultural
system
in
artois

they
raised
no
philosophical


clamour
against
privileges
as
privileges

and
they
had
sense
enough
to


see
that
no
community
could
afford
to
bring
about
the
abolition
of
the


most
obnoxious

privileges

at
the
cost
of
any
flagrant
violations
of


the
rights
of
property


whatever
may
have
been
the
origin
of
these


rights


say
the
authors
of
the

avis



their
antiquity
has
made
them


property
to
be
respected
in
the
hands
of
those
who
possess
it

to


deprive
these
owners
of
these
rights
would
be
an
injustice
and
an
act
of


violence
of
which
no
citizen
can
possibly
dream

the
privileged
orders


must
be
asked
to
divest
themselves
of
their
privileges







here
is
a
recognition
of

vested
interests

for
which
we
may
look
in


vain
from
the
motley
mob
of
the

national
assembly

into
which
the


states
general
of

so
rapidly
resolved

or

to
speak
more


exactly

dissolved

themselves

with
men
of
the
tiers
etat

in
a


province
like
artois

who
could
see
things
so
plainly
and
state
them
so


fairly
before
the
convocation
of
the
states
general

what
became
the


french
revolution

plunging
the
whole
realm
into
anarchy

might
surely


have
been
made
a
reasonable
and
orderly
evolution
of
liberty

such
a


document
goes
a
good
way
in
support
of
the
contention
that
with
ordinary


firmness

consistency

and
courage
on
the
part
of
the
luckless
louis


xvi


the
convocation
of
the
states
general
in


instead
of
leading


france

as
it
actually
led
her

through
a
quagmire
of
blood
and
rapine



into
what
george
sand
felicitously
called
the

merciless
practical
joke


of
the
consulate


and
the
stern
reality
of
the
despotic
first
empire



might
easily
have
resulted
in
converting
the
absolute
monarchy
of
louis


xiv

into
such
a
limited
and
constitutional
monarchy
as
france
really


enjoyed
under
louis
xviii

the
pathway
to
the
inferno
of
the
terror
was


really
paved
with
the
good
intentions
of
the
king






beyond
st

waast
lies
the
considerable
town
of
st

amand
aux
eaux

to


which
general
dumouriez
transferred
himself

on
the
pretence
of
taking


the
waters
there

while
he
was
working
out
his
plans
for
saving
france


by
marching
on
paris
and
upsetting
the
assembly

the
plans
miscarried


mainly
through
his
own
fault

but
it
is
a
curious
vindication
of
the


patriotism
of
dumouriez
in
making
them
that

while
he
was
explaining
to


the
lunatics
in
paris

in
january


the
absurdity
of
attempting
to


overthrow
the
english
power
in
india

and
the
german
empire
in
europe



before
feeding
and
clothing
their
armies
on
the
frontier

de


beurnonville

whom
dumouriez
was
destined
to
seize
and
arrest
at


st

amand

was
himself
writing
from
the
headquarters
at
sarrelouis
to


cochon
lapparent
at
paris
that
everything
was
going
to
the
dogs

and


that
the
government
was
mad
about
chimeras


we
think
of
nothing


he


said


but
giving
liberty
to
people
who
don
t
ask
us
to
do
it

and
with


all
the
will
in
the
world
to
be
free
ourselves

we
don
t
know
how
to


be







st

amand
now
has
a
population
of
ten
or
twelve
thousand
souls

part
of


the
anzin
property
lies
within
the
communal
limits

but
the
place
is
a


busy
place
and
has
industries
of
its
own

it
is
connected
with
anzin
and


with
valenciennes
by
a
steam
tramway

and
i
went
there
with
m

guary
one


fine
summer
morning
to
see
what
is
left
of
the
once
magnificent


benedictine
monastery
of
the
seventeenth
century

which
was
the
great


feature
of
st

amand
a
hundred
years
ago

a
picture
preserved
in
the


collection
at
valenciennes
gives
a
fair
notion
of
the
extent
and


magnificence
of
the
abbey

the
demolition
of
which
has
been
going
on


from

to
this
day

m

guary
remembers
the
stately
ruins
as
much


more
extensive
in
his
youth
than
they
now
are

and
as
the
good
people
of


st

amand
have
very
recently
allowed
the
local
architect
to
put
up



under
the
very
shadow
of
the
exquisitely
beautiful
belfry
still


standing

one
of
the
most
dismal
and
commonplace
brick
school
houses
i


have
seen
in
france

it
is
to
be
presumed
that
a
few
more
years
will
see


everything
pulled
down

and
replaced

perhaps

by
a
miniature


reproduction
in
steel
and
iron
of
the
eiffel
tower






before
the
deviltries
of

began

the
marketplace
of
st

amand
must


have
been
one
of
the
most
picturesque
in
northern
europe

the
market
is


still
held
there

and
the
place
was
full
when
we
crossed
it
of
peasant


women
and
peasants

carts
laden
with
vegetables

tables
set
out
with
all


manner
of
utensils

with
fruits

with
knicknacks

all
was
bustle
and


animation

it
was
the
old
picture

save
for
the
uncomely
modifications


of
our
modern
costume

but
of
the
splendid
architectural
frame
in
which


that
picture
once
was
set

how
little
now
is
left






beside
the
lofty
belfry

one
of
the
most
graceful
seventeenth
century


buildings
now
to
be
anywhere
seen

a
few
arches
of
one
of
the
cloisters


and
one
of
the
great
abbatial
gatehouses
converted
into
a
town
hall

the


vandal
directory
of
chauny
dealt
more
rationally
with
premontre
than
the



patriots

of
st

amand
with
their
superb
abbey

had
they
preserved
it



their
town
would
now
have
possessed
not
only
an
architectural
monument


of
interest
and
importance

but
ample
space
and
the
best
possible



installations

for
all
its
public
uses
and
offices






like
all
the
benedictine
abbeys

st

amand
was
a
home
of
letters
and
of


arts

what
remains
of
its
noble
library
is
to
be
found

as
i
have
said



in
the
collection
at
valenciennes

of
the
treasury
which
the
abbey


contained
in
the
way
of
sculpture

painting

brass
and
iron
work



carving
in
wood

no
such
account
can
be
given

such
of
these
as
escaped


destruction
were
looted

sold

and
dispersed

there
is
a
tradition

well


or
ill
founded

that
some
exceedingly
fine
sixteenth
century
monuments


executed
by
guyot
de
beaugrant

the
sculptor
of
the
matchless


chimney
piece
which

in
the
chambre
echevinale
at
bruges

commemorates


the
expulsion
of
the
french
under
francis
i

from
flanders

were
brought


here
and
set
up
in
the
abbey

if
so

no
trace
of
them
remains

in
the


gatehouse

of
which
the
local
authorities
have
taken
possession

a
few


fine
old
books

relics
of
the
abbatial
library

are
still
kept

and
the


vaulted
chapter
room
on
the
upper
floor

used
now
as
a
council
chamber



contains
four
interesting

dessus
de
porte

painted
here
by
watteau

the


subjects
are
scriptural

of
course

but
as

in
spite
of
all
her
efforts



the
obliging
damsel
who
acted
as
our
cicerone
could
not
possibly
manage


the
blinds
and
sashes
of
the
lofty
window
in
the
octagonal
room
which


they
adorn

it
was
impossible
to
make
out
to
what
period
of
the
artist
s


career
they
belong

upon
one
of
them

the

woman
taken
in
adultery


we


got
light
enough
thrown
to
show
that
its
colouring
is
admirable

it
can


hardly
have
been
painted
while
watteau
was
at
work
in
paris
on
his


endless
reproductions
of
the
then
popular
st

nicholas

but
must


probably
have
been
executed
after
his
study
of
rubens
in
the
luxembourg



and
his
failure
to
win
the
first
prize
at
rome
had
opened
to
him
his


true
path
to
fame

and
carried
him
into
the
french
academy
of
fine
arts


as

the
painter
of
festivals
and
of
gallantry







the
fine
old
church
of
st

amand
has
fared
better
than
the
abbey

it
has


been
judiciously
restored

and
the
third
napoleon
made
it
an
historical


monument

despite
the
radicalism
of
the
place

we
found
it
thronged


with
people
of
both
sexes

the
men

indeed

almost
in
a


majority

attending
a
high
mass

it
was
rather
startling

as
we
emerged


from
this
service
on
our
way
back
to
anzin

to
come
upon
a
large
cabaret


which
bore
for
its
sign
the
words

in
glaring
gilt
letters


au
nouveau


bethlehem

estaminet
barbes


whether
this
is
the
conventicle
of
a
sect


of
believers
in
the
revolutionary
barbes
i
could
not
learn

but
it
is


just
possible
that
the
barbes

whom
it
celebrates

may
be
the


enterprising
proprietor
of
the
place

and
that
the
sacred
name
he
has


given
it
is
a
relic
of
that
familiar
use
of
holy
things
which
never


scandalised
the
good
people
of
the
middle
ages

particularly
in
flanders


and
in
france

does
not
the
best
old
inn
in
the
comfortable
town
of


chalons
sur
marne
to
this
day
bear
the
name
of

la
haute
mere
de
dieu







i
have
already
said
that
the
miners
of
anzin
have
been
practically


enjoying
all
the
advantages
of
co
operation

while
the

true


republicans

of
m

doumer
have
been

studying

and
going
to
sleep
over


that

beautiful
and
generous
idea


as
a
matter
of
fact

the



co
operative
society
of
the
anzin
miners


now
known
in
commerce
as



leon
lemaire
et
cie
of
anzin


was
founded

i
find

even
before
the


co
operative
association
of
the
glass
workers
at
st

gobain






it
was
organised
in


two
years
before
the
passage
of
the
imperial


law
affecting
co
operation






m

casimir
perier

a
son
of
the
minister
of
louis
philippe

and
the


father
of
the
present
republican
deputy
of
the
same
name

was
then
a


director
of
the
anzin
company

he
had
seen
what
m

doumer
fantastically


imagines
to
be
the
purely
french
and
republican

idea

of
co
operation


carried
out
in
england

the

beautiful
and
generous
idea


as
even
every


french
schoolboy
ought
to
know

being
of
english
and
not
of
french


origin






m

perier
had
been
particularly
struck
by
the
great
success
of
the


rochdale
experiment

an
experiment
begun
and
carried
out

as
mr



holyoake
has
set
forth
at
length

by
weavers

who

being
nearly
at
the


end
of
their
tether

and
worn
out
with
distress

had
associated


themselves
into
a
company
under
the
name
of
the

equitable
pioneers
of


rochdale


he
looked
thoroughly
into
the
history
of
this
experiment

and


having
convinced
himself
that
the

beautiful
and
generous

idea
might


bear
as
good
fruit
at
anzin
as
at
rochdale

he
went
to
work
in
earnest



got
the
society
organised

accepted
the
honorary
chairmanship
of
it

and


set
it
on
its
feet
on
february




m

cochin
took
the
same
matter


up
at
st

gobain

and
in

the
imperial
law

about
which
m

doumer


and
his

true
republicans

have
been
cackling
and
dabbling
for
ten


consecutive
years

was
enacted

and
the
co
operative
associations
became


legally
constituted
bodies

the
statutes
which
now
govern
the
anzin


association
were
adopted
on
december




and
the
association
was


formally
launched






the
authorities
at
first
could
not
be
made
to
understand
that
a


co
operative
association
was
not
a
mercantile
speculation

and
for
some


time
the
anzin
association
was
compelled
to
pay
a
regular
fee
for
a


licence

or

patent


as
it
is
called
in
france

this
exaction

however



was
long
ago
given
up






under
the
original
statutes
the
profits
derived
from
the
sale
to
the


members
of
the
association

and
to
them
only

a
rule
never
departed


from


of
all
the
goods
purchased
by
the
association

were
to
be
divided


into
a
hundred
parts

of
these

seventy
parts
were
to
be
distributed
at


the
end
of
each
year
to
the
members

proportionally
to
the
sales
and


deliveries
made
to
each
of
them

twenty
parts
were
to
be
set
aside
for
a


reserve
fund

and
the
remaining
ten
parts
were
to
be
used
by
the


governing
committee
chiefly
in
paying
the
salaries
of
the
manager
and


employees
of
the
association






such
was
the
success
from
the
outset
of
the
anzin
experiment
that
within


six
years

at
a
general
meeting
held
on
april




the
association


adopted
a
resolution
suspending
the
payment
over
into
the
reserve
fund


of
the
twenty
parts
of
the
profits
set
aside
to
be
so
paid

and
ordering


these
twenty
parts
also
to
be
paid
over
to
the
members
semi
annually



the
reserve
fund
had
already
reached
proportions
which
made
it


unnecessary
and
even
undesirable
to
increase
it






the
association
was
originally
constituted
for
a
term
of
twenty
years



from
december




at
a
general
meeting
held
on
march




its


life
was
prolonged
for
another
twenty
years

or
to
december









it
might
edify
m

doumer
as
to
the
nationality
of
the

beautiful
and


generous

idea
which
his

true
republicans

find
it
so
difficult
to



study


if
he
would
take
the
trouble
to
visit
this
anzin
region

he


would
find
the
establishments
of
the
association
currently
known
by
the


english
name
of

stores


i
found
one
of
them
flourishing
in
every


commune
which
i
visited
in
the
vicinity
of
anzin

at
st

waast

where


the
experiment
was
first
made

at
denain

where
during
the
past
year
it


has
been
found
necessary
to
establish
two
stores
instead
of
one

at


anzin

at
fresnes

at
thiers

at
abscon

at
vieux
conde

the


association

indeed

which
began
in

with
fifty
one
members
and
a


subscribed
capital
of


francs

now
conducts
no
fewer
than
fifteen



stores


and
now
consists
of
no
fewer
than


families






the
capital
of
the
association

originally
fixed
at


francs

in



shares
of
fifty
francs
each

was
increased
by
a
vote
of
a
general


meeting
in
april

to


francs

the

firm
name

is
now

lemaire


and
company


the
present
manager
being
m

leon
lemaire

who
can
use


this

firm
name

only
for
the
affairs
of
the
association

the
manager



or

gerant


is
elected
at
a
general
meeting
to
serve
for
three
years



but
he
is
always
re
eligible

his
salary
is
fixed
by
the
governing


committee

and
the
amount
of
it
is
charged
to
the
general
expenses

the


governing
committee
has
power
also
to
present
the
manager

if
it
thinks


proper

with
a
certain
sum
each
year
taken
from
the
ten
parts
of
the


profits
which
are
set
apart
by
the
statutes
of
the
association
to
be


used
for
such
purposes
by
the
committee

all
the
persons
employed
by
the


association
in
various
capacities
are
taken

as
far
as
is
found


compatible
with
the
interests
of
the
business

from
among
the
families


of
the
members

this
is
particularly
the
case
with
regard
to
the
young


girls

of
whom
forty
eight
are
now
employed
in
the
different
drapery
and


mercery
stores

and
an
excellent
practice
has
been
adopted
of
calling
in


a
certain
number
of
girls
when
there
is
a
special
pressure
of
business


to
serve
for
a
short
period

these
girls
being
regularly
registered

and


thus
constituting
a
sort
of
reserve
corps

from
which
the
permanent


employees
are
taken
as
vacancies
are
made






the
operations
of
the
association
cover
all
manner
of
commodities


excepting
butcher
s
meat

it
having
been
found
that
there
are


insuperable
difficulties
in
the
way
of
dealing
in
butcher
s
meat
over
so


wide
an
area

these
difficulties
do
not
exist
in
the
case
of
what
the


french
call

charcuterie


a
central
pork
butchery
has
been
established


just
outside
the

octroi

at
anzin

and
the
business
done
in
that
line


now
averages
about


kilogrammes
a
year

the
difference
per


kilogramme
between
the
buying
and
the
selling
prices
averaging
about


eighteen
francs

it
is
the
iron
rule
of
the
association
never
to
sell
at


a
figure
beyond
the
average
ruling
retail
prices
in
the
shops

it
being


quite
clear
that
if
it
should
now
and
then
be
necessary

in
order
to


cover
the
association

to
sell
at
prices
equivalent
with
the
shop


prices

the
members
would
still
have
a
real
advantage
in
the
eventual


distribution
of
the
profits






it
is
impossible
to
examine
the
statutes

and
the
rules
adopted
under


them

without
being
struck
by
the
precision

clearness

and
efficiency


of
the
methods
prescribed
to
keep
the
accountability
of
all
the


different
agents
of
the
association
within
easily
definable
limits

and


to
simplify

in
the
final
adjustment

the
necessarily
complicated


accounts
of
so
many
stores
dealing
with
customers
many
of
whom
must



from
the
force
of
circumstances

be
allowed
a
credit
of
a
fortnight
as


cash

the
proof
of
all
such
methods

of
course

is
the
net
result

in


the
case
of
the
co
operative
association
of
anzin
this
proof
is


conclusive
in
favour
both
of
the
methods
and
of
the
men
by
whom
they


have
for
now
more
than
twenty
years
been
administered






the
operations
of
the
association
for
the
first
semester
of
its


existence
closed
on
february




with
sales
amounting
to




fr


c


and
with
the
payment
to
the
members
of
an

per
cent



dividend

amounting
in
all
to


francs

from
that
day
to
this

the


semi
annual
dividend
has
never
fallen
below
eight
per
cent


excepting


for
the
half
year
ending
august




when
it
was
declared
at





per
cent

by
august

it
readied

per
cent

and
stood
there
for


three
semesters

it
then
fell
to

per
cent


and
stood
there
from


february




to
august




when
it
rose
to


by
august






it
rose
to


and
by
february




to

per
cent


at
which


figure
it
has
stood
ever
since
down
to
february




with
two


exceptions

august




when
it
rose
to


and
february






when
it
fell
to









the
total
amount
of
sales
made
to
the
members
between
february

and


february

was



francs

and
the
total
amount
of
dividends


paid
to
the
members
during
that
period
has
been



fr


c




showing
an
average
dividend
during
these
twenty
three
years
of




per
cent






it
appears
to
me
that
this
is
a
very
good
account
rendered
of
a
very


good
stewardship

and
involves

for
the
workmen
interested

a
number
of


useful
practical
lessons
on
the
true
relations
of
capital
to
labour



including
the
relations
of
their
own
capital
to
their
own
labour

there


are
now
about

co
operative
associations
of
consumers
in
france

but


the
anzin
association
is
by
far
the
most
important
of
them
all

as
the


existing
associations
are
estimated
to
consist
on
an
average
of



members
each

we
have


heads
of
families

and
a
total
presumable


population

therefore

of
not
far
from




more
or
less


successfully
availing
themselves
of
the
co
operative
principle
in


france

the
net
profits
vary
greatly
in
the
returns
of
these


associations

from

to

per
cent

the
co
operative
coal
association


of
roubaix
shows
a
net
profit
of

per
cent


and
the
co
operative


bakery
of
the
same
busy
and
thriving
city
a
profit
of

per
cent

but


the
anzin
association
not
only
covers
more
ground
than
any
of
the
rest



it
covers
it
in
a
more
equably
satisfactory
fashion

during
the
past


year

on
an
employed
capital
of


francs

it
made
sales
amounting


to



francs

with
a
gross
profit
of


fr


c


and
a
net


profit
of


fr


c

each
man
had
spent
an
average
of

fr




c


and
received
a
net
profit
of

fr


c

in
other
words

every


holder
of
a

franc
share
paid
for
his
share
out
of
a
single
year
s
net


profit

and
pocketed

francs
to
boot






as
indicating
the
scale
of
comfort
attained
in
their
daily
life
by
these


miners
and
their
families

it
is
of
interest
to
glance
over
the


schedule
of
the
goods
and
commodities
supplied
by
these
co
operative


stores

it
being
premised
that
the
stores
do
not
keep
or
sell
what
are


regarded
as

articles
of
luxury


so
that
in
these
schedules
we
have
the


present
scale
of
the
necessaries
and
comforts
of
ordinary
life
among
the


more
industrious
and
thrifty
of
the
french
working
classes

that
even
in


the
seventeenth
century
the
french
artisans

and
the
more
prosperous
of


the
french
peasants

lived
much
more
comfortably
than
one
would
infer


from
the
pictures
usually
painted
even
by
such
historians
as
michelet



who

with
all
his
theories
and
all
his
imagination

took
more
trouble


than
m

thiers
to
keep
within
hailing
distance
of
the
facts

would
seem


to
be
shown
by
the
inventories
and
the
wills
of
artisans
and
peasants


disinterred
during
the
last
quarter
of
a
century
from
the
local
archives


of
troyes
and
other
important
towns






here

in
the
anzin
district

to
day

we
find
these
co
operative
stores


supplying
to


families
of
the
working
class


metrical


quintals
or
bales
of
the
finest
quality
of
wheat
flour



of
these


going
to
the
houses
of
the
members

and


to
the
bakery
of
the


association

which
turns
out

on
an
average



loaves

of

kilos


each

per
day

with
this
bread
the
members
take
from
the
stores
annually




kilos
of
the
best
butter



kilos
of
coffee



kilos


of
chicory



kilos
of
chocolate



marolles
cheeses
from
the


land
of
bretigny

where
edward
iii

was
scared
by
a
tremendous


thunderstorm

which
made
him

think
of
the
day
of
judgment


into
giving


peace
to
france
and
liberty
to
her
captive
king



kilos
of


potatoes



kilos
of
prunes

kilos
of

bottles
of

bottles
of

of

of


various
sorts

of

of

kilos
of

and

kilos
of

kilos
of

kilos
of

kilos
of

and
other
products


of
the
pork
butchery

that
butcher
s
meat

which

for
the
reasons
i
have


mentioned

the
stores
cannot
supply

plays
a
large
proportional
part
in


the
obviously
good
dietary
of
these
families

may

i
think

be
inferred


from
the
fact
that
the
stores
annually
dispose
of


pots
of
the


best
french
mustard

and
of


kilos
of
white
pepper

vegetables
and


fruits
are
supplied
in
abundance
by
the
country

and
in
many
cases
by


the
allotments
of
the
workmen
themselves

while
beer

as
i
have
said

is


everywhere
abundant
and
cheap






that
the
miners
and
working
people
of
anzin
are
well
lodged
and
well
fed


may
be
considered
to
be
beyond
a
doubt

let
us
now
see
what
they
do
in


the
way
of
clothing
themselves

and
of
furnishing
their
houses






they
buy
from
the
stores
annually


francs

worth
of
kitchen
and


household
utensils

which
are
both
well
made
and
cheap
in
all
this
part


of
france


kilos
of
mattrass
wool



yards
of
sheeting


wool


and
cotton
blankets
and
bedspreads



towels



pairs
of


sabots



pairs
of
shoes



caps
and
hats



pairs
of


stockings



shirts
and


metres
of
shirting



metres
of



pique




undervests
and


metres
of
flannel





handkerchiefs



metres
of
linen
goods



metres
of
lustrines





metres
of
merinos



metres
of
muslins



metres
of



indiennes




francs

worth
of
mercers

wares



metres
of


calicoes

and

finally



yards
of
velvet

when
we
remember
that


this
is
the
annual
outlay
for
keeping
up
the
household
wardrobe

not
the


original
outlay
in
establishing
it

it
seems
to
me
that
the
workpeople


of
anzin
ought
to
be

and
indeed
one
need
only
walk
and
drive
about
the


region
to
see
that
they
are

at
least
as
well
clothed
as
they
are
housed


and
fed






umbrellas
even
have
come
to
be
regarded
as

necessities

here

and
the


stores
annually
supply


of
these
useful
but
essentially
fugitive


articles

the
men
are
clothed
by
their
village
tailors
and
bootmakers


chiefly

so
that
the
masculine
wardrobe
is
represented
in
the
accounts


of
the
stores
less
extensively
than
the
feminine

but
the
anzin
miners


nevertheless
annually
invest
in
scarves
and
cravats
to
the
number
of


more
than



each
man
on
going
into
the
employ
of
the
company


receives

as
i
have
said

a
complete
mining
outfit

the
cost
of
which
is


not
defrayed
out
of
his
wages

but
the
miners
annually
buy

on
an


average


new
mining
suits
for
themselves






tables

chairs

bedsteads

bureaux

well
made
and
often
handsome

are
to


be
had
in
all
these
communes
at
very
low
prices

and
i
went
into
no


house
in
any
of
them
which
did
not
seem
to
me
well
equipped
in
these


particulars

engravings

coloured
and
plain
and
lithographs

are
to
be


found
in
them
all

and
though
the
people
are
obviously
not
much
addicted


to
literature

i
found
in
one
miner
s
house
at
thiers
quite
a
collection


of
books

and
most
of
them
good

sensible

and
instructive
books



installed
in
an
upper
chamber

in
which
the
housewife
said

her

man



liked
to
sit
and
read
when
it
was
too
hot
out
of
doors
in
the
garden






this
good
dame

by
the
way

was
of
the
opinion
that

the
house
gives
you


the
character
of
the
wife


and
that

the
conduct
of
the
husband
depends


upon
the
character
of
the
wife


her
own

man

was
evidently
an


excellent
and
orderly
person

so
i
considered
it
a
legitimate
compliment


to
assure
her
that
i
entirely
agreed
with
her






i
hope

for
the
future
of
france

that
she
may
be
right

for
there
seems


to
be
a
tendency
here

as
there
certainly
is
in
other
parts
of
france



to
insist
on
sending
their
girls
to
the
religious
schools

even
when


they
allow
their
boys
to
attend
the
lay
schools

where
they
are
exposed


to
having
the

true
republican

deputies
and
functionaries
of
the
time


get
up

as
m

doumer
did
the
other
day

at
the
opening
of
a
new
lay


school
in
the
aisne

and
propound
the
doctrine
that

morals
have
nothing


to
do
with
religion







the
lay
schools
are
attended

for
example

in
anjou
by


boys

and


only


girls

while
the
free
congreganist
schools
are
attended
by




girls

and
only


boys






adding
the
number
together

this
gives
us
a
total
of


children
in


the
religious

as
against


in
the
anti
religious
or
irreligious


schools
of
one
province






if
my
good
housewife
at
thiers
is
right
as
to
the
influence
of
the


character
of
the
women
in
france
upon
the
conduct
of
the
men

there
is


hope
in
these
figures

which
i
am
assured
pretty
fairly
represent
the


state
of
things
in
flanders
as
well
as
in
anjou

with
the
difference


that
the
proportion
of
boys
attending
the
religious
schools
is
probably


larger
in
flanders
than
in
anjou

m

doumer
s
doctrine
that

morals


should
be
taught
independently
of
religion

certainly
did
not
commend


itself
to
all
his
constituents

the

journal
de
st

quentin


commenting


upon
it

plainly
said


the
verdicts
of
our
assize
courts
show
us
every


day
the
result
of
the
atheistic
instructions
recommended
by
m

doumer


and
the
rest
of
the
masonic
brothers

the
truth
simply
is
that
if
some


remedy
be
not
soon
found
for
the
situation
created
by
these
people

who


are
as
stupid
as
they
are
mischievous

in
a
few
years
we
shall
be


obliged
either
to
decuple
the
gendarmerie

or
to
allow
every
citizen
to


go
about
armed
with
a
revolver

in
order
to
protect
himself
against
our


much
too
liberally
emancipated
young
scolos







curiously
enough
this
voice
from
st

quentin
in
france
substantially


echoes
another
voice
from
another
st

quentin
in
california

the
seat
of


the
state
penitentiary
in
that
young
and
active
and
opulent
american


commonwealth

in
california
the
plan
of
giving
instruction
in
morality



independently
of
religion

has
been
tried
much
longer
than
in
france



and
certainly
in
circumstances
much
more
favourable
to
its
success

the


result

as
set
forth
in
an
official
report
of
the
resident
director



cited
by
mr

montgomery

ex
assistant
attorney
general
of
the
united


states

in
his
treatise
on

the
school
question


is
that

while
the


illiterate
convicts
in
the
california
penitentiary

at
the
date
of
the


report

numbered


against

who
could
read
and
write



among
the


younger
convicts
they
could
all
read
and
write








i
have
already
spoken
of
many
of
the
advantages
offered
by
the
anzin


company
to
its
workmen
and
miners

as
amounting
really
to
a
kind
of


participation
in
the
profits
of
the
company

this

i
think

must
be


admitted
to
be
clearly
the
case
with
regard
to
certain
regulations


affecting
workmen
s
pensions

established
here
by
the
governing
council


of
the
company
in
december







these
regulations
are
to
affect
workmen
who
contribute
to
what
is
known


as
the

national
retiring
fund
for
old
age


this
fund
was
established


originally
in

under
the
presidency
of
louis
napoleon

it
was


re
organised
by
a
law
passed
in
july


and
by
a
decree
issued
in


december


it
is
under
the
guarantee
of
the
state

and
is


administered
by
a
committee
co
operating
with
the
ministry
of
commerce



its
object
is
to
enable
working
men
and
others
to
secure
annuities
up


to
the
amount
of


francs
a
year

at
or
after
the
age
of
fifty

by


the
payment
of
small
regular
assessments
on
their
wages

the
smallest


sums
are
received
by
the
fund

which
of
course
is
managed
on
principles


not
unlike
those
of
the
great
life
insurance
companies

a
running


account
is
kept
with
the
treasury
to
meet
the
current
expenses
of
the


fund

but
all
the
rest
of
the
money
received
by
it
is
invested
in
the


french
public
funds

or
in
securities
guaranteed
by
the
state

no
part


of
the
compound
interest
received
by
the
fund
is
deducted
to
meet
the


expenses
of
administration

it
all
goes
to
the
account
of
the


depositors

the
current
expenses
being
met
by
the
deposit
fund

which


manages
the
retiring
fund

if
at
any
time
before
that
fixed
for
his


enjoyment
of
the
retiring
pension

the
depositor
should
be
made


incapable
of
work
by
some
illness
or
accident

he
is
at
once
put
into


possession

without
awaiting
the
age
fixed
in
the
original
agreement

of


a
pension
or
annuity
proportioned
to
the
amount
of
his
actual
payments


and
to
his
age
at
the
time
when
the
incapacity
is
medically
and
legally


established






every
year
a
certain
amount
is
voted
by
the
chamber
as
a
subvention
to


this
fund

and
out
of
this
annual
appropriation
these

premature


pensions

may
be
increased
by
the
committee
in
charge
of
the
fund

this


is
a
sort
of
practical
state
socialism
beyond
a
doubt

but
it
is
at


least
as
respectable
as
the
expenditure
made
in
this
year
s
budget
of





francs

or
about
one
fifth
of
the
whole
amount
of
the
french


naval
pension
list

on
annuities
of
indemnification

to
the
victims
of


the

coup
d
etat

of



the

coup
d
etat

of

having
been
simply


a
collision
between
the
legislature
of
that
year

trying
to
suppress
the


executive

with
the
executive
trying
to
suppress
the
legislature

with


the
result
that
the
executive
carried
the
day

and
that
the
french


people

by
an
overwhelming
majority

approved
the
victory
of
the


executive






why
the
socialistic
principles
at
the
bottom
of
the
national
retiring


fund
for
workmen
should
not
be
extended
to
others
than
working
men
it
is


not
easy
to
see

the
french
pension
list
is
now
very
heavy

it
figures


in
this
year
s
budget
at
nearly
a
hundred
millions
of
francs

exclusive


of
the
military
and
naval
pensions

which
amount
to
about
one
hundred


and
twenty
five
millions
more

and
without
counting
the

debits
de


tabac


which
are
in
fact
a
kind
of
pensions
used
freely
by
deputies
and


other
functionaries
of
influence
to
reward
services
of
all
sorts

of


these
about
two
hundred
were
given
away
in


the
list
filling
five


pages
of
the
huge
reports
of
the
finance
ministry






the
national
retiring
fund
for
old
age
is
managed
by
a
high
committee
of


sixteen

which
must
include
two
deputies

two
state
councillors

two


presidents
of
mutual
aid
societies

and
one
manufacturer

workmen
who


choose
to
avail
themselves
of
the
fund
may
break
off
and
renew
their


payments
into
it
as
they
like

and
increase
or
diminish
the
amount
of


their
annual

the
regulations
adopted
by
the
anzin
council
in

are
intended
to


duplicate
the
results
of
this
system
of
the
national
retiring
fund
for


the
benefit
of
any
workman
who
chooses
to
make
himself
a
depositor
in


the
national
fund
to
the
amount
of



per
cent

of
his
annual
wages






suppose

for
example

a
miner
earning


francs
a
year
chooses
to


deposit
in
the
national
retiring
fund

fr


c

a
year

upon


verification
of
this
the
anzin
company
will
pay
into
the
same
fund
for


him
annually
an
equal
sum

this
would
give
the
miner
who
began
his


deposit
of

fr


c

a
year
at
the
age
of
thirty

a
pension
income
at


the
age
of
fifty
of

fr


c


or
just
about
the
pension
income


which
he
would
draw
at
the
age
of
sixty
five
from
the
national
fund
if


he
began
a
payment
of

francs
a
year
into
that
fund
at
the
age
of


thirty
two

a
miner
who
began
his
annual
deposit
of

fr


c

in
the


national
fund
at
the
age
of
twenty
one

taking
advantage
then
of
the


regulations
of
the
anzin
council

would
enjoy
at
fifty
a
pension
income


of
very
nearly

francs
a
year






under
the
anzin
regulations

the
two
payments
made
by
and
for
the


workmen
concerned
are
inscribed
in
an
individual
bank
book
which
becomes


his
property

the
sums
paid
in
by
the
company
are
alienated

and
to
the


exclusive
advantage
of
the
workman

while
he
is
left
at
liberty
to


alienate
or
reserve
his
own
payments

if
he
is
married

of
course
his


personal
payments
are
held
to
be
made
one
half
for
the
benefit
of
his


wife






in
the
case
of
subterranean
miners

the
company
will
begin
to
carry
out


this
system
as
soon
as
they
enter
its
service

and
without
regard
to


their
nationality

in
the
case
of
the
surface
workmen

they
must
be


eighteen
years
of
age

and
must
have
been
in
the
service
of
the
company


for
at
least
three
years
without
interruption

the
reasons
for
the


difference
are
obvious






the
payments
of
the
company
cease
at
fifty
years

but
the
workman
is


not
obliged
to
draw
his
pension
income
then

as
by
continuing
his


personal
payments
he
can
put
it
off

thereby
increasing
it
until
he


attains
the
age
of




or







to
meet
the
case
of
miners
drawn
into
the
army

the
company

as
long
as


the
miner
so
drawn
and
returning
to
its
service
shall
remain
in
its


service

will
pay
in
fractions

and
within
a
period
equal
to
that
of
his


military
service

into
the
national
fund
for
his
benefit
a
sum
equal
to


the
percentage
he
would
himself
have
paid
into
the
national
fund
upon


his
wages

calculating
them
as
being
the
same
during
the
period
of
his


military
service
that
they
would
have
been
had
he
remained
there
at
work


in
the
mine






in
the
case
of
a
workman
who
falls
ill
or
is
injured

the
company

if
he


is
a
member
of
a
mutual
aid
society

which
will
make
his
personal


percentage
payments
for
him

will
pay
itself
an
equal
sum
during
his


illness
or
incapacity
for
at
least
one
calendar
year

after
that
each


case
must
be
separately
dealt
with






furthermore

and
in
addition
to
these
general
conditions

the
company


will
grant
to
workmen
long
in
its
service

who
shall
have
made
their


regular
payments
to
the
national
retiring
fund
under
these
regulations



when
they
give
up
work

supplementary
pensions
calculated
at
the
rate
of



francs
a
year
for
fifteen
years
of
service
for
the
miners

and
of



fr


c

a
year
for
fifteen
years
for
the
surface
workmen

these


supplementary
pensions
are
doubled
for
married
workmen

so
that
they
may


amount
to

francs
a
year
for
miners

and
to

francs
a
year
for


surface
workmen






on
the
whole

i
think
the
miners
of
anzin
knew
what
they
were
about
when


they
stood
aloof
from
the

strike

in
the
pas
de
calais

to
do
this
was


to
aid
the

strikers

themselves
much
more
effectually
than
by
joining


in
the
strike

for
surely
the
spectacle
of
such
an
orderly
prosperity
as


exists
at
anzin

the
result
of
equitable
relations
maintained
for
years


between
capital
and
labour

is
the
strongest
possible
argument
in


support
of
the
reasonable
demands
of
labour

but
what
are
the
reasonable


demands
of
labour






it
appeared
from
an
inquiry
made
by
the

society
of
mineral
industries



after
the
great
strike
of


that

out
of
ten
coal
producing


companies
in
the
north
of
france
which
maintained
assistance
funds
for


the
miners

the
anzin
company
alone
did
this
entirely
at
the
expense
of


the
company

the
nine
other
companies
reported
a
joint
revenue
of




francs
in

for
these
assistance
funds

of
which
amount
the


workmen
furnished


francs

the
outlay
for

exceeded
the


revenues
and
amounted
to


fr


c

but

in
addition
to
the




francs
furnished
by
the
workmen
to
these
funds

the
nine


companies
in
question
expended
themselves

in
pensions

medical
service



school
subventions

free
fuel

hospitals
and
other
contributions
to
the


welfare
of
these


miners
and
workmen

no
less
than



fr




c

so
that
while
the
workmen
expended
on
an
average

per
cent

of


their
wages
in
maintaining
assistance
funds

these
nine
companies



excluding
anzin

where
no
demand
was
made
on
the
workmen

expended
for


the
benefit
of
the
workmen
and
their
families
an
amount
equal
to

per


cent

of
the
wages
paid
by
them

and
to

per
cent

of
the
interest
and


dividends
paid
to
the
stockholders

on
the
average
the
companies
thus


spent
about

c

for
every
ton
of
coal
extracted






could
labour
reasonably
demand
more
than
this
of
capital






under
the
leadership
of
deputies
like
mm

basly
and
camelinet

backed


by
the
revolutionary
press
of
paris

the
miners
in
another
part
of


france

at
decazeville

went
on

strike

in
january


they
began
by


brutally
murdering
m

watrin

one
of
the
best
managers
in
the
country



they
kept
the
whole
region
idle
and
in
terror
for
three
months
and
a


half

they
inflicted
great
loss
on
the
company
and
disturbed
all
the


industries
of
france

they
themselves
lost


francs
of
wages

the


company
finally
granted
an
increase
of
wages
representing
only



per


cent

of
the
wages
sacrificed
by
the
strike

the
municipal
council
of


paris

which
had
fomented
the
strike

magnificently
gave
the
miners




francs
of
money
which
did
not
belong
to
them

all
the
radical


press
together
subscribed


more

the
decazeville
charities
gave





and
the
next
year
all
the
miners
testified
that
they
had
been


quite
content
with
the
wages
before
the
strike

and
gave
a
banquet
to


the
chief

french
flanders
became
politically
french
more


than
two
centuries
ago

but
it
still
remains
essentially
flemish

the


land
has
a
life
and
a
language
of
its
own

like
brittany
or
alsace

the


french
fleming
is
rarely
as
haughty
in
his
assertion
of
his
nationality


as
the
french
breton

but
when
a

monsieur
de
paris


or
any
other
outer


barbarian

comes
upon
a
genuine

flamand
flamingant


there
is
no
more


to
be
made
of
him
than
of
a

breton
bretonnant


standing
calmly
at

in
a

of

of
peter

enveloped
in


her

even
in
the
great
and
busy
cities
of
lille
and
roubaix

the
flemish


tongue
holds
its
own
against
the
french
with
astonishing
pertinacity



but
if
french
flanders
is
still
more
flemish
than
french

the
flemings



i
believe

are
very
good
frenchmen

just
as
i
imagine
the
most


enthusiastic
welshmen
of
mr

gladstone
s
beloved
little
principality



would
be

after
all

found

at
a
pinch

to
be
very
good
englishmen






architecturally

their
ancient
flemish
capital

lille

now
the
chief


town
of
the
great
department
of
the
nord

is
decidedly
more
french
than


flemish






the
seven
sieges
it
has
sustained
have
left
it
quite
bare
of
great


historic
monuments

and
during
the
past
thirty
years
millions
of
francs


have
been
spent
upon
its
streets

squares

and
boulevards

with
the


result
of
giving
it
the
commonplace
and
comfortable
look
of
a
growing


quarter
of
paris

its
famous
old
walls
have
been
improved
off
the
face


of
the
earth

and
i
am
glad
to
say
that
few
if
any
of
the
noisome


cellars
seem
still
to
exist
in
which

when
i
first
knew
the
place

not


so
very
long
ago

thousands
of
its
industrious
working
people
used
to


dwell
like
troglodytes






marlborough
s
cannon
spared
the
fine
seventeenth
century
spanish
lonja



and
there
are
traces
still
to
be
discerned
about
the
modernised
mairie


of
the
ancient
palace
of
jean
sans
peur
and
charles
the
fifth

but
there


is
no
flemish
building
here
comparable
with
the
hotel
de
ville
and
the


beffroi
of
douai

of
old
flemish
customs
and
traditions

however

there


is
no
lack
in
lille

and
i
came
upon
a
curious
proof
of
the
vitality
of


its
local
patriotism

this
was
the
regular
publication

in
the
most


widely
circulated
morning
newspaper

of
a
series
of
carefully
prepared


articles
on
the
archaeology
and
antiquities

the
legends
and
the
archives


of
the
old
flemish
capital

one
of
the
editors
of
this
journal
showed
me


in
his
office
a
collection
of
these
articles

reprinted
from
the


newspaper

and
now
filling
some
twenty
volumes






i
spent
my
first
midsummer
morning
at
lille
in
the
musee
which
has
been


installed
in
the
hotel
de
ville

the
wicar
collection
of
drawings
there



i
need
hardly
say

is
of
itself
a

liberal
education

in
art

during
his


long
residence
at
rome
in
the
via
del
vantaggio

the
chevalier


jean
baptiste
wicar
wasted
neither
his
time
nor
his
money

what


treasures
were
then
to
be
picked
up
by
such
a
man

for
wicar
died
not


long
after
the
revolution
of
july


where
he
found
his
masaccios



robert
browning
told
me
that
he
knew

but
where
did
he
find
that


incomparable
bust
in
wax
which
charms
with
all
the
mystic
feminine
grace


and
more
than
all
the
feminine
beauty
of
the
mona
lisa

possibly
m



carolus
duran
may
be
able
to
throw
light
upon
this

for
he
was
one
of


the
earliest
beneficiaries
who
profited
by
the
fund
which
the
chevalier


wicar
founded
for
the
purpose

as
he
says
in
his
will

of

giving
to


young
men

natives
of
lille

who
devote
themselves
to
the
fine
arts

the


means
of
sojourning
at
rome
for
four
years

under
certain
conditions







the
chevalier
wicar
was
a
good
catholic

and
he
gave
to
his
fund
the


title
of
the

pious
foundation
of
wicar







i
suppose
that
under
the
third
republic
this
monstrous
recognition
of
an


unscientific
emotion
would
have
sufficed
to
vitiate
the
scheme

in
which


case
france
would
have
lost
the
artistic
achievements
of
m

carolus


duran






the
house
in
the
via
del
vantaggio
i
believe
still
makes
a
part
of
the



pious
foundation


and
the
municipality
of
lille
has
very
sensibly


added
a
yearly
sum
of

francs
to
the


francs
allotted
under
the


will
of
the
chevalier
wicar
to
each
beneficiary

together
with
a


travelling
outfit
of

francs






coming
back
from
the
musee
to
breakfast
in
my
very
comfortable
hotel


near
the

gare


i
found
there
awaiting
me
m

grimbert
of
douai

who
had


most
obligingly
come
over
to
show
me
what
the
friends
of
religion
and
of


liberty
are
doing
in
lille
to
prove
that
the
religious
sentiment
is
not



dead

in
this
part
of
france

and
that
the
christians
of
french


flanders
do
not
intend
to
let
their
children
be

laicised

into
the


likeness
of
m

jules
ferry
and
m

paul
bert

without
an
effort
to


prevent
it






the
department
of
the
nord
has
long
been
conspicuous
in
france
for
the


number
and
the
excellence
of
its
educational
institutions

the


statistics
collected
by
m

baudrillart
show
that
it
stands
side
by
side



in
this
respect

with
the
department
of
the
seine

of
the

communes


which
make
up
the
department
of
the
nord

only
three
in

were


without
a
school

the
department
contains



inhabitants

of


these

considerably
more
than
one
third

or



live
in
the



cantons
and

communes
of
the
arrondissement
of
lille

which
includes


of
course
the
city

and
here
we
find

public
schools



classes


for
instruction

and

free
educational
establishments

over
against


this
organisation
of
education
must
be
set
a
very
notable
development
of


intemperance

i
do
not
infer
this
from
the
extraordinary
amount
of


beer
drinking
which
goes
on
in
the
nord

to
the
extent

according
to
m



baudrillart

of

bottles
a
year
to
every
man

woman

and
child
in
the


department

against

in
the
ardennes
and

in
the
pas
de
calais



for

after
all

it
may
be
doubted
whether
habitual
drunkenness
is
much


more
common
in
beer
drinking
than
in
wine
drinking
countries

and
there


can
be
no
question

i
think

that
it
is
much
less
common
in
countries
in


which
wine
is
abundant
and
cheap

than
in
countries
in
which
wine
is
an


imported
luxury

but
the
consumption
of
alcoholic
liquors
is
apparently


on
the
increase
in
this
great
department






at
the
beginning
of
this
century

long
before
lille
and
roubaix
had


begun
to
draw
into
their
factories
such
great
numbers
of
the
rural


population
as
now
yearly
throng
into
these
prosperous
cities

a
prefect


of
the
department

m

dieudonne

declared
that
it
was
not
an
unusual


thing
to
see
workmen
in
lille
who
worked
only
three
days
in
the
week
and


spent
the
other
four
in
drinking
corn
brandy
and
hollands
gin

at
that


time
the
workpeople
of
the
sister
city
of
roubaix
had
a
much
better


reputation

while
of
the
rural
populations
of
french
flanders
dr



villerme
then
affirmed

after
a
careful
study
of
their
habits

that


nothing
was
to
be
seen
among
them
of
the

debauchery
and
the
daily
and


disgusting
drunkenness
prevalent
in
the
large
towns







persons
familiar
with
the
rural
aspects
of
the
nord
assure
me
that
this


can
no
longer
be
said
with
truth
of
the
rural
farm
labourers

it
is



probably

more
true
of
the
farmers
and
of
their
families
than
it
was


fifty
years
ago

but
it
is

unfortunately

also
less
true
than
it
then


was
of
the
rural
labourers

the
number
of
small
cabarets
has
quadrupled


during
the
last
quarter
of
a
century
in
the
arrondissement
of
douai


alone

which
contains

cantons


communes

and


inhabitants



the
majority
of
them
occupied
in
agriculture

and

taking
the
whole


department

it
appears
that
the
consumption
of
spirits
represents
an


increase
of

per
cent

in
the
average
consumption
of
pure
alcohol
in


the
last
forty
years

it
rose
from


litres

in


for
every
man



woman

and
child

to


litres

in


and
it
is
now
estimated
to


reach

litres

which
would
represent
an
annual
consumption
of
about



bottles
of
brandy
at

degrees

for
every
man

woman

and
child
in
the


department

i
did
not
happen
to
see
any
drunken
women
or
children
in
the


department

but
m

jules
simon

in
his
work


l
ouvriere


gives
an


uncanny
account
of
feminine
drunkenness
at
lille

where
there
are


special
cabarets

it
seems

for
women

i
believe
no
special
estaminets


have
yet
been
set
up
there
for
women
addicted
to
tobacco

and

indeed

i


do
not
know
that
the
civilisation
of
french
flanders
has
yet
reached
the


point
of
treating
the
question

whether
women
ought
to
smoke

as
a


practical
question

worthy
the
grave
attention
of
savants
and


philosophers

possibly

if
england

like
france

had
enjoyed
the


advantage
of
sixteen
changes
in
her
form
of
government

and
of
three


successful
foreign
invasions

during
the
past
century

questions
of
this


sort
might
now
subtend
no
greater
an
arc
in
england
than
they
now


subtend
in
france

and
it
certainly
ought
to
interest
englishmen
to
know


that
the
example
of
england
is
freely
cited
in
lille

roubaix



tourcoing

and
other
centres
of
flemish
life
and
activity

to
support


the

noble
and
military

amusement
of
cock
fighting

to
which
the
good


people
of
these
regions
are
extraordinarily
addicted

a
law
was
passed


against
this
practice
under
the
presidency
of
prince
louis
napoleon
in




and
many
attempts
have
since
been
made
to
suppress
it

but
with


small
success

a
republican
prefect
of
the
nord

some
years
ago



actually
wrote
to
the
president
of
the
society
for
the
prevention
of


cruelty
to
animals
that
he
would
not
hesitate
to

enforce
the
provisions


of
the
law
against
cock
fighting
whenever
the
practice
seemed
to
be


likely
to
become
too
general


i
do
not
know
that
i
ever
stumbled
on
a


more
delightful
recognition
of
the
eleventh
commandment
of
demagogism





vox
populi
vox
dei



naturally

with
such
encouragement
as
this

the


sport
of
late
years
has
been
assuming

i
am
told

a
recognised
place


among
the
amusements
of
the
people

fighting
cocks
go
into
the
arena
as


champions
of
the
towns
in
which
their
owners
dwell

and
if
the
feathered


achilles
of
roubaix
does
the
feathered
hector
of
tourcoing
to
death

the


spectators
not
unfrequently
take
up
the
quarrel

divide
into
two
camps



and
have
it
out
handsomely
on
the
spot

these
things
i
note
because
they


tend
to
show
how
difficult
it
is
to
develop
an
ideal
civilisation
in
a


few
years
by
the
simple
process
of
forbidding
men
to
teach

or
to


believe
in

the
existence
of
a
divine
ruler
of
the
universe






for
the
same
reason

and
without
unduly
dwelling
upon
it

i
may
here


record
the
statement
made
to
me
by
an
editor
of
an
influential
journal


in
lille

that
in
no
city
in
france
has
the
evil
of
juvenile


prostitution
taken
such
root
as
here

when
i
expressed
my
surprise
at


this

the
french
law
as
to
the

detournement
de
mineures

being
at
least


as
stringent
as
the
english

he
replied


how
can
you
expect
such
a
law


to
be
enforced
under
this
government


and
he
then
went
on
to
show
me
in


an
old
file
of
his
journal
an
account

now
some
years
old

of
the


adventures
of
a
deputy
from
versailles
in
the
palais
royal
at
paris




our
republicans


he
said


are
firm
believers
in
the
great
principle


of
the
solidarity
of
all
the
party
with
all
the
haps
and
mishaps
of


every
member
of
the
party







a
more
confirmed
pessimist

by
the
way

than
this
journalist
i
have
not


seen
in
france

he
was
quite
convinced
that
the
republicans
would
show
a


majority
in
the
seven
circumscriptions
or
districts
of
lille
at
the


elections
in
the
autumn

and
he
criticised
very
severely
the
attitude
of


the
catholics
at
lille
in
regard
to
politics


they
are
excellent


people


he
said


but
they
think
too
much
of
the
souls
of
the
people


and
not
enough
of
their
votes







i
ventured
to
suggest
that
perhaps
the
picture
which
he
had
himself
set


before
me
of
the
moral
condition
of
the
city
of
lille

at
least

might


be
thought
to
afford
some
excuse
for
this
preoccupation
of
the
catholics


with
the
spiritual
rather
than
the
political
interests
of
the
people






but
to
this
he
would
not
listen
for
a
moment







no

no


he
said


the
first
thing
to
be
done
for
the
souls
of
the


people
is
to
get
rid
of
these
fellows
at
paris

are
they
not
paganizing


the
country

here
is
this
new
law
which
is
demoralising
the
army

why
do


they
wish
to
force
the
seminarists
into
the
service

is
it
not
avowedly


because
they
think
this
will
stop
the
recruiting
for
the
ranks
of
the


clergy

why
are
they
attacking
the
foundations
of
the
magistracy

is
it


not
because
the
french
magistrates
stand
between
them
and
the
rights
of


the
french
clergy
as
french
citizens

how
far
off
are
we
from
a
revival


of
danton
s
beautiful
doctrine
that

in
order
to
consummate
the


regeneration
of
society

all
conditions
imposed
upon
the
eligibility
of


citizens
to
act
as
judges
ought
to
be
immediately
abolished

so
that
a


tinker

or
a
butcher

or
a
bootblack

or
a
chiffonnier
might
be
made
a


french
magistrate
just
as
well
as
a
trained
student
of
the
laws

as
you


know

one
of
the
first
things
danton

as
minister
of
justice

did
was
to


carry
through
the
convention
his
famous
decree
making
this
doctrine
law


in
france







i
am
worn
out


he
said


with
trying
to
make
our
good
people
here


understand
that
they
must
go
into
the
battle
field
of
politics
and
put


these
fellows
out
of
power
at
paris
if
they
mean
to
prevent
france
from


falling
into
absolute
anarchy
once
more

i
cannot
make
them
move

and
i


believe
we
shall
be
beaten
in
all
the
seven
districts
of
lille







i
am
glad
to
say
the
event
proved
that
my
pessimistic
friend
was
by
far


too
pessimistic

of
the
seven
seats
to
which
the
arrondissement
of
lille


is
entitled

four
were
carried
by
the
monarchists

in
two
cases
without


an
attempt
seriously
to
contest
them

and
if
the
seven
candidates
had


been
voted
for
on
a
single
list

that
list
would
have
been
elected
by


the
arrondissement






the
monarchists
threw
in
the
whole
arrondissement


votes

the


opportunist
republicans



the
radicals



and
the
socialists





so
that
the
monarchists
had
a
clear
majority
of


votes
over


all
the
factions
of
the
republican
party
put
together

in
one
district


of
lille

the
st

the
boulangists
threw


votes

if
we
put
these


down

which
we
have
no
right
to
do

as
republican
votes

the
monarchists


still
show
a
clear
majority
of


in
the
whole
arrondissement
of


lille

and

as
i
have
said

if
the
representation
of
france
by


arrondissements
were
really
a
representation
by
arrondissements
and
not


by
circumscriptions

the
seven
hundred
thousand
people
of
this
great
and


prosperous
department
of
north
eastern
france
would
now
be
represented


at
paris
not
by
four
monarchists
and
three
republicans

but
by
seven


monarchists

this
may
serve
to
show
how
exceedingly
unsafe
it
is
to


assume
that
the
nominal
party
complexion
of
the
majority
in
a
chamber


elected
as
the
present
french
chamber
has
been
really
gives
foreign


observers
anything
like
an
accurate
notion
of
the
state
of
public


opinion
and
the
drift
of
popular
feeling
in
france
at
this
time






a
friend
to
whom
i
am
indebted
for
an
analysis
made
with
great
care
of


the
electoral
results

not
in
this
very
important
department
alone

but


throughout
france

points
out
to
me
the
exceedingly
significant


difference
between
the
majorities
given
to
the
monarchists
and
to
the


republican
deputies

in
the
th
district
of
lille

for
example

m

des


rotours

the
monarchist
candidate

received


votes

being
the


largest
poll
by
far
given
to
any
candidate
in
the
whole
arrondissement



and
not
one
vote
was
thrown
against
him

in
the
th
district
the


republican
candidate
was
declared
to
be
elected
by
no
more
than



majority
in
a
total
poll

hazebrouck

an
essentially
flemish
town
of
some


inhabitants



and
the
arrondissement

which
comprises

cantons
and

communes



contains


inhabitants

is
absolutely
flemish

the
early


sixteenth
century
church
of
st

nicholas
at
hazebrouck

with
its
lofty


and
graceful
spire

was
begun
about
the
time
of
the
first
voyage
of


columbus

and
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
extant
flemish
buildings
of


that
time

the
people
of
this
arrondissement
and
their
neighbours
in
the


arrondissement
of
dunkirk
were
almost
as
famous
before

as
the
dutch


for
their
skill
as
florists
and
their
success
in
developing
all
manner


of
eccentric
varieties
of
roses

tulips

primroses

and
pinks

i
do
not


know
that
they
ever
managed
to
produce
a
blue
rose

but
they
came
very


near
it

and
at
the
present
time
their
rich
and
level
country
is
gay


with
cottage
gardens

they
are
given
to
sociability
also

for
the


arrondissement
possesses

i
am
told

at
least
one
cabaret
for
every



inhabitants

but
then
the
cabarets
in
the
department
at
large
average



to
every

inhabitants

and
in
the
thoroughly
agricultural


arrondissement
of
avesnes
they
number

for
every

inhabitants

in
the

of

a
property
of
from
five
to
twenty
hectares
is


called
a
small
farm

in
the
arrondissement
of
hazebrouck

a
farmer


cultivating
from
six
to
fifty
hectares
passes
for
an
agriculturist
of


the
middle
class

the
people
are
prosperous

and
their
hostility
to
the


republic
seems
to
have
its
origin
chiefly
in
the
intolerance
and


extravagance
of
the
government

this
is
the
case
too

apparently

with


their
neighbours
in
the
arrondissement
of
dunkirk

the
st
district
of


dunkirk
elected
a
boulangist
revisionist
by
a
solid
vote
of




against


votes

given
not
to
a
government
republican
but
to
a


radical

while
the
nd
district
of
dunkirk
elected
a
monarchist
by
a


majority
of


votes
in
a
poll
of








in
the
face
of
such
figures
as
these
it
seems
to
me
that
the
friends
of


religion
and
of
liberty
in
the
department
of
the
nord
hardly
merit
the


reproach
put
upon
them
by
my
pessimistic
journalist
at
lille
of


lukewarmness
in
the
political
battle
of







neither
he
nor
any
one
can
well
accuse
them
of
lukewarmness
in
any
other


matter
affecting
the
interests
either
of
religion
or
of
liberty

and
i


cannot
help
hoping
that
my
northern
pessimist
may
perhaps
have


over
estimated
the
prevalence
of
juvenile
prostitution
in
lille
as
much


as
he
certainly
underestimated
the
devotion
of
the
monarchists
of
lille


to
their
political
flag

his
gloomy
prognostications
as
to
the
issue
at


the
polls
were
probably
enough
inspired
by
his
thorough
knowledge
of
the


extraordinary
preparations
made
by
the
authorities
for
manipulating
the


returns

on
this
point
he
gave
me
some
particulars
which
appear
to
be


borne
out
by
subsequent
events

it
is
curious
for
example
to
learn
from


the
analytical
table
to
which
i
have
already
referred
in
connection
with


the
elections
at
lille

that
of
the

government
candidates
returned


as
elected
at
the
first
balloting
of
september



were
returned
as


elected
by
majorities
of
less
than


votes

while
of
the



monarchists
returned
as
elected
on
the
same
day

only

were
returned


as
elected
by
majorities
of
less
than


votes

of
the



republicans



or
about
one
in
eight

were
returned
as
elected
by


majorities
of
less
than

votes

while
of
the

monarchists

only




or
about
one
in
thirteen

were
returned
as
elected
by
similar


majorities

when
we
remember
that
the
machinery
of
these
elections
was


absolutely
controlled
by
the
prefects
under
instructions
from
m



constans

the
minister
of
the
interior

which
were
not
made
public



this
circumstance
is
certainly
very
significant

some
of
the
details


sent
me
by
my
analytical
correspondent
make
it
still
more
significant



in
the
nd
district
of
st

nazaire

for
example

the
monarchist


candidate
was
elected
without
a
competitor

receiving


votes

in


the
st
district
of
st

nazaire
the
government
candidate
was
returned
by


a
majority
of
no
more
than

votes

the
returns
giving
him


votes


to


for
his
monarchist
opponent

this
margin
is
almost
as


suggestive
as
the
majority
of

votes
by
which
m

razimbaud

a


government
candidate
for
the
district
of
st

pars

in
the
department
of


the
herault

was
declared
three
days
after
the
balloting
of
october

to


have
been
returned
over
his
monarchist
opponent

the
baron
andre
reille



in
this
same
department
of
the
herault

the
prefect
and
the


councillors
general
returned
m

menard
dorian

the
government
candidate



as
elected

at
lodeve

over
m

leroy
beaulieu

the
distinguished


political
economist

by
a
majority
of

votes

in
this
case
it
seems
a


certain
number
of
votes
thrown
in
one
commune
for
both
candidates
were


set
aside

to
be
annulled
for
informality

when
the
returns
went
up
to


the
council
for
revision

the
informal
votes
cast
for
m

leroy
beaulieu


were
declared
invalid

the
informal
votes
cast
for
m

menard
dorian
were


declared
good
and
valid

and
m

menard
dorian
was
proclaimed
to
have


been
elected

the
committee
of
the
chamber
reported
against
the
seating


of
m

menard
dorian

and
tried
to
have
this
report
accepted

but
as
i


write
the
chamber
has
not
accepted
it

and
the
odds
are
that
m



leroy
beaulieu

who

though
a
moderate
republican

has
made
himself


obnoxious
to
the
government
by
telling
the
truth
about
the
financial


condition
of
france

will
be
kept
out
of
the
seat
which
it
is
tolerably


plain
that
he
was
elected
to
fill






it
is
difficult
for
an
englishman

even
for
an
american

to
understand


the
cynical
coolness
with
which
things
of
this
sort
are
done
in
the


french
republic
of
the
present
time

and
not
very
easy
to
understand
the


apathetic
way
in
which

when
done

they
are
accepted
by
the
french


public

there
seems
to
be
little
doubt
that
in
england
of
late
years


ballot
boxes
have
been

stuffed

only
by
the
stupidity
of
the
voters



and
not
by
the
ingenious
rascality
of
the
political
managers

i
wish
i


could
with
an
easy
conscience
say
the
same
thing
of
my
own
country

but


even
in
the
united
states
deliberate
tampering
with
the
returns
of
a


political
election
has
not

i
think

been
practised
since
the
evil
days


of
reconstruction
at
the
south
with
the
calm
disregard
of
appearances


shown
by
the
government
managers
during
the
legislative
contest
of
this


year



in
france

and
certainly
there
has
been
nothing
known
in
the


congress
of
the
united
states

since
the
days
of
reconstruction

at
all


comparable
with
the
systematic
invalidation
by
the
majority
in
the


french
chamber
of
the
elections
of
troublesome
members
since
it


assembled
on
november


in
the
cases
of
general
boulanger
and
of
m



naquet

the
latter
of
whom
resigned
his
seat
in
the
senate
to
stand
as
a


boulangist
candidate
for
the
chamber

this
invalidation
was
carried
out


openly
as
a
party
measure
and
precisely
in
the
spirit
of
the
famous
or


infamous
resolution
which
robespierre
made
the

section
of
the
pikes



adopt

to
the
effect
that
the
electors
of
paris
must
be
protected


against
their
own
incapacity
to
choose

true
patriots

by
having
the



true
patriots

chosen
for
them

if
this
be
one
of
the

principles
of





it
must
be
admitted
that
the
third
republic
is
consistently
and


courageously
acting
upon
it

it
has
undoubted
advantages

but
it
has
a


tendency

perhaps

to
put
in
question
the
value
of
what
are
commonly


called
representative
institutions

strike
out
of
the
theory
of


representative
institutions
the
right
divine
of
the
people
to
choose
the


wrong
men

and
what
is
left
of
it






at
the
close
of
the
election
of
september




in
paris

the
major


of
the
nd
or
clignancourt
district
of
the
eighteenth
arrondissement
of


the
department
of
the
seine
declared
that
general
boulanger
had
received




votes
out
of


cast

and
that
he
was
therefore
elected

of


his
competitors

one
m

joffrin

described
as
a

possibilist


had


received


votes

m

jules
roques

a
socialist

had
received



votes

and
for
a
citizen
bearing
the
gloomy
but
respectable
name
of
m



cercueil

or

m

coffin


one
vote
had
been
cast

obviously
general


boulanger
was
the
man
whom
a
majority
of
the
voters
of
clignancourt


desired
to
represent
them

if
general
boulanger
for
their
own
sake
could


not
be
allowed
to
represent
them

why
not
m

cercueil

they
certainly


did
not
choose
m

cercueil
to
represent
them

but
as
certainly
they
did


not
choose
m

joffrin
to
represent
them






what
really
happened

the
prefect
of
the
seine

on
hearing
the
result
at


clignancourt

notified
the
minister
of
the
interior

and
orders
were
at


once
given
to
correct
this
egregious
error
into
which
the
voters
of


clignancourt
had
fallen
as
to
what
their
true
interest
required

it
was


probably
found
that
an

informality

had
occurred
in
certain
communes



and
that
through
this


votes
must
be
annulled

news
of
this


discovery
was
instantly
sent
to
the
parisian
newspapers

as
it
was


supposed
that
they
would
give
m

joffrin
a
plurality
of
the
votes
to
be


recognised

sundry
newspapers
actually
printed
the
name
of
m

joffrin
at


the
head
of
the
list
of
candidates
in
the
place
usually
accorded
by
a


really
enlightened
press
to
the
elect
of
universal
suffrage



unfortunately
the
official
calculator
is
not
of
the
blood
of
bidder

it


was
found
at
the
last
moment
that
enough
votes
had
not
been

annulled



to
put
m

joffrin
at
the
head
of
the
poll

so
that
his
name
actually


appears
in
sundry
parisian
morning
papers
of
september


first
indeed


in
position

but
over
against
it
are
recorded


votes

while
the


name
of
general
boulanger
comes
second
with


votes

clearly
an


awkwardness

in
the

journal
des
debats


which
is
a
serious
republican


journal
of
character

the
election
of
general
boulanger
by


votes


was
quietly
announced

with
a
postscript
to
the
effect
that

the


prefecture
of
the
seine

gave
a
different
result


arising
from
the


circumstance
that
in
certain
sections


votes
bearing
the
name
of


general
boulanger
had
been
asserted
to
be
null
and
void


and
that



therefore

there
would
be
a
second
election

or

ballottage


on
october









there
could
hardly
be
a
more
pregnant
commentary
than
this
upon
the


candid
admission
made
by
the
most
respectable
and
influential
republican


journal
in
paris

the

temps


on
october




that
these

second


elections


or

ballottages


are
simply
a
device
by
which
the
central


government
at
paris
is
enabled
to

correct

the
errors
perpetrated
by


the
voters
of
france
at
the
elections
which
precede
them


to
learn
the


true
sentiments
of
the
country


said
the

temps



we
must
consult
the


elections
of
the
th

on
that
day

universal
suffrage
was
allowed

to


choose
freely
between
the
opposing
parties
and
policies

the
vote
of


to
morrow
will
not
be
as
clear
and
precise

for
it
will
be
determined
by



tactical
necessities
and
by
all
sorts
of
combinations








perfectly
true

but

this
being
true

what
becomes
of

popular


sovereignty

and
of
the
divine
quality
of
the
rights
derived
from


universal
suffrage
as
contrasted
with
rights
derived
from
inheritance



or

for
that
matter

with
rights
derived
from
a
dice
box
or
the


shuffling
of
a
pack
of
cards

considering
what
the
usual
origin
is
of



tactical
necessities

in
politics

and
what
forces
determine
political



combinations
of
all
sorts


is
it
going
too
far
to
say
that
the
odds



so
far
as
public
interests
are
concerned

are
in
favour
of
the
dice
box


or
the
pack
of
cards

provided
the
dice
be
not
loaded
or
the
cards


specially
packed






some
years
ago

in
my
own
country

a
well
known
austrian
dined
with
me


one
night

just
before
he
sailed
for
europe
after
a
tour
in
the
united


states

we
spoke
of
a
public
man
just
then
filling
a
very
responsible


position
at
washington

to
which
he
had
been
named
after
a
severely


contested
and
very
costly
election


i
thought
him
a
very
pleasant



intelligent
man


said
my
austrian
guest


but
it
struck
me
that
you


spend
too
much
time
and
trouble
and
money
on
getting
just
such
men
into


such
places

we
get
very
much
the
same
calibre
of
men
for
the
same
kind


of
work
much
more
economically
and
easily
by
the
simple
process
of


marrying
a
prince
to
a
princess







what
i
have
seen
and
learned
this
year
of
the
working
of
the
electoral


machinery
in
france
under
the
third
republic
inclines
me

as
i
have


already
said

to
think
that
the
catholic
children
of
light
in
lille
and


in
french
flanders
generally
may
be
doing
better
work
both
for
religion


and
for
liberty
than
my
pessimistic
journalist
was
disposed
before
the


elections
to
believe

if
they
had
given
more
time
and
thought
and
money


to

tactical
necessities

and

political
combinations


and
less
to
the


social
and
spiritual
interests
of
the
land
in
which
they
live

the


results
even
of
the
elections
might
perhaps
have
been
less
satisfactory


to
them

for

as
i
have
shown

the
strength
of
the
monarchist
vote
in


this
region
proved
to
be
much
greater
than
my
pessimist
thought
it


would
be

and
the
republicans
of
the
third
republic
did
a
deal
of


canvassing
for
the
monarchists
by
making
it
very
hard
for
men
who
love


religion
and
liberty
to
vote
for
republican
candidates






lord
beaconsfield
s
saying

that
the
world
is
governed
by
the
people
of


whom
it
hears
the
least

is
certainly
not
less
true
of
the
catholic


church
than
it
is
of
the
world

the
catholic
stock
in
french
flanders
is


as
vigorous
and
full
of
sap
as
in
belgium
or
in
holland

it
is


interesting
to
hear
educated
people
talking
glibly
in
london
or
paris


about
the
decay
of
the
christian
religion
in
the
same
breath
in
which


they
profess
their
unbounded
admiration
of
the
heroism
of
father
damien



it
was
through
no
act
or
wish
of
father
damien
that
the
world
at
large


came
to
know
his
name

or
to
take
account
of
a
work
which
was
done
not


to
be
seen
of
men

he
was
simply
a
flemish
catholic

doing
what
he


believed
to
be
the
will
of
god






throughout
the
broad
rich
plains
of
the
great
department
of
the
nord



and
in
its
crowded
busy
towns
and
cities

this
catholic
faith
is


everywhere
to
be
seen
and
felt

to
be
felt
rather
than
to
be
seen
in
its


fruits
of
charity

self
denial

and
devout
self
sacrifice






nowhere
in
france
is
public
charity

i
am
told

so
extensively
and


efficiently
organised

and
the
demands
upon
public
charity
are


exceptionally
great

the
department
is
very
rich
and
very
prosperous



but
it
contains

like
all
frontier
regions

a
large
floating
population



and
one
of
the
best
informed
men
i
met
in
lille

a
large
landed


proprietor
in
one
of
the
wealthiest
communes
of
the
department

told
me


that
there
are
probably
more
families
or
tribes
of
hereditary
mendicants


scattered
over
french
flanders
than
are
to
be
found
in
any
other
french


province






these
are
not
nomads
addicted
to
wandering
off
into
other
regions

but


rather
a
kind
of
northern
lazzaroni

they
do
a
little
work
occasionally



but
as
little
and
as
seldom
as
possible

they
are
inveterate
poachers



and
the
more
industrious
of
them
are
habitual
smugglers

in
their
way
of


prosecuting
this
industry

however

they
show
their
fine
natural


instinct
for
avoiding
labour

the
most
profitable
trade
they
drive
is
in


tobacco

this
they
get
over
the
frontier
from
belgium

and
to
get
it


they
train
a
certain
breed
of
dogs

they
tie
parcels
of
tobacco
around


the
throats
of
these
dogs

and
then
proceed
to
have
the
dogs
well


thrashed
by
one
of
their
number
dressed
in
the
custom
house
uniform

a


few
lessons
of
this
sort
suffice
to
develop
in
the
dogs
a
strong


association
of
ideas
between
the
odour
of
tobacco
and
the
thwacks
of
a


cudgel

and
a
dog
well
educated
in
this
way
may
be
trusted

after
he
has


got
his
cargo
in
belgium

to
reach
his
master
s
den
unvisited
by
the


french

douane


baudrillart
confirms
this
account

he
puts
the
number


of
habitual
applicants

largely
from
this
mendicant
class

for
public


relief
in
the
department
at
from
two
hundred
to
two
hundred
and
fifty


thousand
a
year

out
of
the

communes
in
the
department
there
were


only
twenty
in

without
a

bureau
de
bienfaisance


and
the


department
spends
five
millions
of
francs
a
year
on
its
charities



independently
of
nearly
twice
that
amount
expended
upon
hospitals



asylums

dispensaries

and
the
like

by
private
benevolence

under
the


french
law

private
donors
can
found
charities
to
be
attached
to
the


public

bureau
de
bienfaisance


and
administered
by
the
public


officers

and
one
of
the
many
evil
effects
of
the
war
declared
against


catholic
france
by
the
third
republic
is
that
it
affects
such
charities


very
seriously






even
under
the
empire
trouble
came
of
the
occasional
division
of
one


commune
into
two
or
more
communes

a
question
then
arising
as

for


example

in
a
famous
case
of
the
communes
of
st

joseph
and
st

martin


in
the
loire

about
the
division
between
the
poor
of
the
two
communes
of


three
hospital
beds
left
to
the

bureau
de
bienfaisance

of
the
original


commune
of
st

martin

it
was
easier
for
the
military
saint
himself
to


divide
his
cloak
with
the
shivering
beggar
than
for
the
commune
which


bore
his
name
to
divide
three
beds
into
two
equal
portions

at
lille



two
or
three
years
ago

a
lady

mme

austin
laurand

the
widow
of
m



laurand

in
accordance
with
her
husband
s
will

gave


francs
to


the

bureau
de
bienfaisance

of
the
city

the
income
thereof
to
be


applied

under
the
supervision
of
three
commissioners

to
encouraging


habits
of
thrift
among
the
apprentices
of
lille

two
hundred
bank
books


of
five
francs
each
are
annually
given
to
apprentices
in
the
first
two


years
of
their
apprenticeship

and
the
rest
of
the
income
is
to
be
given


in
prizes
each
year
to
those
of
the
bank
book
holders
who
shall
be
shown


to
have
been
the
most
careful
and
thrifty
in
managing
the
results
of


their
labour
during
the
year






a
law
passed
in


before
the

true
republicans

of
gambetta
and


ferry
came
into
power

provides
for
a
medical
inspection
and
record
of


newly
born
children

and
this
law
puts
infants

whenever
it
may
be
found


necessary

under
proper
hygienic
conditions

it
has
been
nowhere
so


energetically
carried
out
as
in
the
nord

of
course

such
a
law
as
this


flies
directly
in
the
face
of
the
great
gospel
of
the

survival
of
the


fittest


but
though
that
gospel
was
introduced
to
paris
on
the
stage
as


one
of
the
curiosities
of
the
centennial
exposition
of


it
has
made


little
progress
as
yet
in
catholic
france

even
at
the
theatres
in


paris

i
am
glad
to
say

the
popular
instinct
still
regulates
the



queue

on
principles
quite
inconsistent
with
the
darwinian
maxims
of



every
man
for
himself


and

the
devil
take
the
hindmost


it
will
be


an
evil
day
for
invalids
and
cripples
bitten
with
the
drama
when
the



struggle
for
life

comes
to
be
logically
developed
into
the
right
of


the
strongest
men
to
get
first
to
the
ticket
office






throughout
the
department
of
the
nord

primary
schools
exist
for
the


children
who
are
taken
in
charge
at
their
birth
by
public
benevolence



and
those
to
whom
they
are
confided
are
obliged
to
see
that
the
children


attend
these
schools
from
the
age
of
six
to
the
age
of
twelve
years






under
the
influence
of
the
church
acting
upon
the
naturally
sociable
and


gregarious
temperament
of
the
flemish
race

mutual
aid
societies
have


become
very
numerous
of
late
years
in
the
nord

a
hundred
and
fifty
two


such
societies
now
exist
in
the
arrondissement
of
lille
alone

these


numbered

in




honorary
members
and


paying
members

and


their
assets
were
stated
at
about



francs

only


women



however

were
enrolled
on
their
lists

is
this
a
confirmation

i
wonder



of
the
theory
entertained
by
mr

emerson
and
other
philosophers

that


woman
is
not
a

clubbable

animal






putting
this
aside

however

for
the
moment
as
a
more
or
less

academic



question

it
is
of
interest
to
note
the
very
considerable
development


during
the
last
few
years
of
the
principle
of
association
among
the


working
men
and
producers
of
france

under
the
influence
of
the
church


and
of
conservative
public
men
like
m

welche

one
of
the


extra
parliamentary
ministers
of
the
marshal
duke
of
magenta

who
did


good
service
here
at
lille
as
prefect
of
the
department
of
the
nord

and


who
has
made
the
french
law
of

affecting

professional


syndicates


so
useful
throughout
the
agricultural
world
of
france






it
is
one
of
the
organic
statutes
of
the
society
of

foreseers
of
the


future


or

prevoyants
de
l
avenir


that
all
political
and
religious


discussions
are
forbidden
at
the
meetings
of
the
society







this
society
was
established
at
paris
on
december




on
february






it
was
authorised
to
act
as
a

civil
society


by
the
minister


of
the
interior
and
the
prefect
of
police

its
object
is
to

ensure
to


all
its
members
who
shall
have
co
operated
in
maintaining
it
for
twenty


years

the
first
necessaries
of
life


i
shall
not
attempt
here
to
go
in


detail
into
the
statutes
and
organisation
of
the
society

suffice
it
to


say
that
the
statutes
are
brief

clear

and
sensible

and
that
the


organisation
appears
to
be
eminently
practical

the
members

to
the


number
of
whom
no
limit
is
set

the
only
indispensable
condition
being


that
they
shall
be
in
good
health
and
actively
employed
in
some
trade
or


calling

pay
an
entrance
fee
of
two
francs

and
a
monthly
due
of
one


franc

this
monthly
due
must
be
paid
in
advance

and
a
fine
of



centimes
is
imposed
for
every
month
in
arrears

each
member
receives
a


book
containing
the
statutes

which
establishes
his
title
to
its


benefits

and
for
which
he
pays

centimes

donations
may
be
received



and
under
the
authority
of
the
officers
entertainments
may
be
given

the


profits
of
which
go
to
the
general
fund

any
respectable
person

no


matter
what
may
be
his
calling

may
become
a
member

if
he
has
attained


the
age
of
fifteen
years

and
women
are
not
excluded


having
the
same


duties


say
the
statutes


they
have
the
same
rights


but

despite


this

it
is
provided
that
women
who
are
members
shall
not
be
fined
if


they
fail
to
attend
the
general

in

of

unless
they
shall
have
previously
by
letter
excused


themselves






every

at
the
expiration
of
twenty
full
years
of

shall


be
entitled
to
his

of
the

earned
during
the
twentieth


year
of
his

by
the
property
of
the
society

the
funds
of


which
can
only
be
invested
in
the
three
or
five
per
cent

funds
of
the


french
nation

his
regular
contribution
to
the
society
will
still
go
on



but
he
will
receive
his
share
of
the
interest
earned
thereafter


regularly
every
three
months

should
a

die

the

s


interest
due

shall

over

the

and
the

have
no
claim
upon
the

of
the

to


the

should
a

become
an
invalid

incapable
of
work

after


fully
paying
up
his
dues
to
the
society
during
five
years

he
may
demand


to
be
kept
upon
the
books
as
a
full
member

and
as
such
he
will
be


entitled
to
his
pension
at
the
end
of
twenty
years

the
society
can
only


be
dissolved
by
a
unanimous
vote
of
the
members
at
a
general
meeting



and
if
so
dissolved
the
members
must
choose
another
society
as
nearly
as


possible
resembling
this

to
which
the
property
of
the
dissolved
society


shall
be
transferred






the
funds
for
current
expenses
of
the
society
can
never
exceed




francs

this
society

as
i
have
said

was
founded
in


its
success


has
been
really
phenomenal






on
january




it
comprised

members

and
its
capital
amounted


to


francs

on
january




it
consisted
of


members



and
had
a
capital
invested
in
french
consols
of


fr


c

on


april




it
numbered


members

divided
into

sections



and
it
possessed
an
invested
capital
of



fr


c


of
course


the
tontine
principle
enters
into
the
system

and
it
would
be


interesting
to
compute
the
probable
pensions
in

of
so
many
of
the



persons
who
were
members
of
the
society
in

as
may
then
be


living
to
claim
their
share
of
the
interest
then
earned
by
the
then


capital
of
the
society

the
minuteness

precision

and
practical
common


sense
with
which
the
statutes
of
this
organisation
have
been
drawn
up


and
provision
made
in
its
regulations
against
all
the
probable


difficulties
to
be
encountered
in
carrying
it
on

gives
one
a
very


favourable
notion
of
the
business
capacity
and
of
the
character
of
the


french
working
classes

no
conditions
as
to
sex
or
nationality
are


imposed
upon
membership

the
only
necessary
qualification
being
that
the


person
applying
to
be
admitted
shall
be
actively
employed
in
some
way



be
domiciled
in
france

and
be
sixteen
full
years
of
age

it
strikes
me


that
organisations
of
this
sort
are
more
likely
to
promote
a
practical


solution
of
the
labour
question
than
combinations
to
secure
the
passage


of
laws
fixing
the
number
of
hours
for
which
a
man
shall
be
allowed
to


work






the
church
has
taken
an
active
part
in
fostering
the
development
of


these
mutual
aid
societies
throughout
this
great
department

and


particularly
in
lille
and
roubaix

the
disasters
of
the
franco
german


war
gave
a
great
impulse
to
them

these
disasters
did
more
to
strengthen


and
deepen
than
all
the
vulgar
violence
of
the
pseudo
scientific
and


pseudo
literary
atheism
of
parliamentary
paris
has
yet
done
to
weaken


the
religious
sentiment
in
france

and
the
french
catholics
cannot
be


cited
to
illustrate
aubrey
de
vere
s
noble
saying
that

worse
than


wasted
weal
is
wasted
woe







i
spent
a
most
interesting
morning
at
lille
with
m

grimbert
in
visiting


the
buildings
and
the
collections
of
the
great
catholic
university
which


has
been
founded
here
to
meet
the
assault
of
m

ferry
and
his
allies
on


the
higher
education
in
france

this
catholic
university
has
been


endowed
and
is
maintained
entirely
by
the
private
liberality
of
the


catholics
of
the
department
of
the
nord

and
by
the
revenues
it
derives


from
the
students
who
attend
its
courses

it
is
a
thoroughly
equipped


university
of
the
first
rank

the
rector

monseigneur
baunard

is
a


roman
prelate

and
of
the
two
vice
rectors

one
is
a
prelate
and
the


other
a
canon

these

with
the
deans
of
the
faculties

and
five


professors
elected
from
the
corps
of
instructors

constitute
the


academic
senate

the
administrative
council
comprises
the
archbishop
of


cambrai

the
bishop
of
arras

to
the
benevolence
of
one
of
whose


predecessors
france
is
indebted
for
the
education
which
enabled


robespierre
to
avenge
upon
the
church
and
upon
his
country
what
in
one


of
his
letters
he
calls

the
intolerable
slavery
of
an
obligation


received



the
bishop
of
lydda

the
chancellor
of
the
university

and


the
rector

the
theological
faculty
comprises
a
dean
and
nine


professors

the
law
faculty
a
dean

the
comte
de
vareilles
sommieres



and
thirteen
professors

one
of
these
gentlemen

m

arthaut

was
so
kind


as
to
receive
m

grimbert
and
myself

and
to
show
us
over
the
whole


institution

the
medical
faculty
comprises
a
dean

dr

desplats

and


twenty
three
professors

the
faculty
of
philosophy
and
letters

a
dean



dr

margerie

and
seven
professors

the
faculty
of
sciences

a
dean

dr



chautard

and
nine
professors






the
buildings
of
the
university
now
occupy
two
sides
of
an
immense


square
in
one
of
the
finest
quarters
of
lille

and
when
fully
completed


will
occupy
the
whole
square

as
they
now
stand
they
are
by
far
the


most
striking
edifices
in
lille

and
would
do
honour
to
any
city
in


europe

the
area
covered
by
them

i
should
say

is
larger
than
that


covered
by
the
university
of
london

and
certainly

from
the


architectural
point
of
view

they
need
fear
no
comparison
with
the


london
establishment

the
library

which
is
admirably
arranged

already


contains
about


volumes

and
the
apparatus
of
the
scientific


schools
is
admittedly
better
than
that
of
any
institution
in
france

the


outlay
already
made
here
exceeds



fr


or
about


l




sterling

all
of
which
has
been
contributed
freely
by
the
catholics
of


this
region






on
the
face
of
things
it
appears
to
me
that
the
existence
of
this


university
is
somewhat
inconsistent
with
the
notion
that

the
religious


sentiment
is
dead
in
france


the
classes
are
now
attended
by
between


four
and
five
hundred
students

for
whose
accommodation
three

family


houses

have
been
already
built

in
which
students
are
lodged
at
an


expense
of
from


to


fr

a
year

and
when
the
academic


buildings
now
in
process
of
construction
are
completed

more
than
a


thousand
students
can
be
thus
lodged

two
dispensaries

a
maternity


hospital

under
the
charge
of
sisters
of
charity
of
st

vincent
de
paul



together
with
the
large
hospital
de
la
charite

are
directly
connected


with
the
clinical
service
of
the
medical
faculty

and
are
so


administered
as
to
render
the
most
important
services
to
the
industrious


population
of
the
city

the
electrical
department
of
the
faculty
of


sciences
is
particularly
well
equipped

and
one
of
the
assistants
in


charge
of
this
department

who
showed
us
some
improvements
recently


devised
here
in
the
working
apparatus

surprised
me
by
the
extent
and


minute
accuracy
of
his
information
as
to
all
the
most
recent
progress


made
in
the
applications
of
electricity
to
machinery

and
to
the
arts
on


both
sides
of
the
atlantic






i
was
not
surprised

however

to
learn
from
m

arthaut
that
the


astonishing
prosperity
of
this
great
institution
is
viewed
with
extreme


dissatisfaction
by
the
authorities
at
paris

and
particularly
by
the


university
of
france

which
has
been
confirmed
again
under
the
third


republic
in
the
monopoly
of
academic
privileges

of
which
it
was
very


sensibly
deprived
by
the
assembly
under
the
government
of
the


marshal
duke
of
magenta

by
way
of
expressing
this
dissatisfaction
with


dignity
and
emphasis

the
government
of
the
third
republic
actually


forbids
free
catholic
universities
to
use
the
title
of
universities

m



ferry
s
article

not
being
yet
law
in
this
best
of
all
possible
french


republics

catholics
cannot
be
prevented
from
spending
their
own
money


in
founding
institutions
which
are
really
universities

but

at
all


events

they
can
be
forbidden
to
give
any
one
of
them
the
title
of
a


university

that
being
reserved
for
the
state
establishment

which

from


paris

extends
its
academic
sway
all
over
france






i
called
the
attention
of
m

arthaut
to
the
fact
that
a
great
catholic


university
has
been
this
year
founded
in
the
capital
of
the
republic
of


the
united
states

and
that
the
president
of
the
republic

himself
a


protestant

not
only
attended
the
ceremonies
of
the
foundation

but
made


a
brief
speech

in
which
he
expressed
his
best
wishes
for
its
progress


and
prosperity


that

i
am
afraid


said
m

arthaut


is
a
kind
of


republic
which
we
are
not
likely
to
see
established
in
france







to
measure
the
significance
of
this
catholic
work
in
behalf
of
liberty


and
religion
here
at
lille

it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
very
men


who
are
building
it
up
with
such
splendid
liberality
and
enterprise
are


compelled
by
the
iniquitous
laws
of
the
third
republic
to
bear
their
own


share
as
taxpayers
in
supporting
here
at
lille
another
academic


institution
of
a
similar
scope

but
of
less
importance

under
the
direct


control
of
the
university
of
france

from
all
share
in
the


administration
of
which
religion
and
the
ministers
of
religion
are
as


rigidly
excluded
as
that
refugee
of
the
first
french
revolution

stephen


girard

intended
they
should
be
from
the
college
which
he
founded
at


philadelphia

of
course
the
same
thing
is
true
of
the
catholics
all
over


france

out
of
their
pockets
must
come
nine
tenths
of
the
enormous
sum



as
yet
quite
incalculable

but
certainly
running
far
up
in
the
hundreds


of
millions
of
francs
which
is
still
to
be
expended
by
the
third


republic
upon
its

scholastic
palace


and
the
ever
increasing
army
of



lay
teachers


male
and
female

whom
it
is
yearly
turning
out
of
the


educational
institutions
of
france
to
seek
the
employment
which
a
vast


majority
of
them
cannot
possibly
hope
to
find
in
the
public
schools

the


lyceums
and

faculties

of
the
nation






on
this
point
a
councillor
general
whom
i
met
here
at
lille
dwelt
with


very
grave
emphasis


we
are
educating
here
in
france


he
said
to
me




hundreds
of
young
men
and
young
women
every
year
under
false
pretences


to
enter
a
profession
already
overcrowded

for
every
post
which
now


exists
or
which
can
be
created
within
the
next
ten
years
in
the


educational
system
of
these
revolutionists
at
paris

we
are
turning
out


at
least
a
hundred
applicants
each
year
of
each
sex

who
must


necessarily
be
thrown
upon
the
public

what
will
become
of
them

the


young
men
will
go
into
nihilism

as
young
men
of
the
same
sort
do
in


russia

the
young
women
will
go
upon
the
street

only
the
other
day
at


paris

the
government
advertised
a
competition
for
about

positions
in


the
telegraphic
service

how
many
young
women
applied

more
than




what
is
to
become
of
the

unsuccessful
competitors

and
what
right


has
the
state
to
flood
the
market
thus

in
advance
of
the
necessities
of


the
country

and
at
the
cost
of
the
taxpayers

with
male
and
female


teachers

any
more
than
with
carpenters

or
with
surgeons

or
with


confectioners







one
circumstance
connected
with
the
development
of
this
great
catholic


university
at
lille

as
an
american
i
permit
myself
to
give
the


institution
its
proper
title

is
of
special
significance

it
is
not
the


only
institution
of
the
kind
which
has
been
called
into
existence
in


france
since
the
third
republic
began
its
war
against
religion
in




there
is
a
free
catholic
institution
at
lyons

which
consists
of
three


faculties
under
the
administration
of
a
company
founded
to
receive
and


administer
all
sums
given
or
bequeathed
to
organise
the
institutes

the


archbishop
of
lyons
is
chancellor
of
this
institution

which
has
a
dean


and
seven
professors
of
theology

a
dean
and
eighteen
professors
of
law



with
a
secretary
and
librarian
of
that
faculty

a
dean
and
seven


professors
of
letters

a
dean
and
nine
professors
of
science

there
are


similar
institutions
also
at
angers
and
at
toulouse

all
of
these
are


freely
supported
by
the
private
subscriptions
of
catholic
france

as
is


also
the
great
catholic
institute
of
paris
in
the
rue
vaugirard

so


admirably
conducted
by
monseigneur
d
hulst

the
vicar
general
of
paris



thanks
to
the
law
of
july




and
to
the
stand
made
by
the
friends


of
liberty
and
religion
when
the
law
of
march




was
finally


enacted

the
students
of
the
faculty
of
law
in
these
catholic
institutes


still
have
the
right
to
present
themselves
with
the
certificates
of


their
several
institutes
at
the
public
examinations
for
the
diplomas
of


the
baccalaureate

the
licentiate
and
the
doctorate
in
law

and
for
the


certificate
of
capacity
in
the
law

necessary
to
enable
the
successful


candidates
to
practise
the
legal
profession
in
france

to
maintain
the


efficiency
of
the
free
catholic
institutions

the
catholics
of
france


have
spared
during
the
last
few
years
neither
labour
nor
money

more


than



francs
have
been
contributed
during
that
period
to


establish
the
catholic
educational
system
in
paris
alone

and
more
than





francs
are
yearly
subscribed
there
to
keep
it
up

as
i
have


already
said

the
university
here
at
lille
represents
an
expenditure


during
the
same
period
of
more
than



francs
and
a
still
larger


prospective
expenditure






it
would
be
interesting

if
it
were
possible

to
learn
how
much
out
of


their
own
pockets
the
propagandists
of
unbelief
have
expended
during


this
same
decade
upon
the
irreligious
education
of
the
children
of
their


countrymen

were
the
truth
attainable

the
amount
expended
by
them
would


be
found
to
bear
to
the
amount
received
by
them
from
their
propaganda
of


unbelief
much
less
than
the
proportion
of
falstaff
s

pennyworth
of


bread

to
his

intolerable
deal
of
sack


while
the
catholics
of
france


have
been
giving
millions
to
defend
the
right
of
the
french
people
to


protect
the
faith
of
their
children

these
men
have
been
expending


hundreds
of
millions
of
the
money
of
catholic
taxpayers
upon
school


buildings

the
contracts
for
erecting
which
have
been
controlled
by


themselves
for
their
friends

they
have
been
finding
places
in
the


public
educational
service
for
their
friends

dependants
and
allies

and


they
have
been
comfortably
drawing
large
salaries
themselves
from
the


treasury






set
over
against
these
incontrovertible
facts

the
fact

as


incontrovertible

for
which
i
am
indebted
here
to
m

grimbert

that
of


the
millions
expended
in
defence
of
liberty
and
religion
here
at
lille



a
very
large
proportion
has
been
contributed
by
one
single
catholic


citizen
of
this
ancient
flemish
city

who
has
consecrated
his
life
and


his
fortune
to
his
faith
in
the
spirit
of
the
earliest
christian
times



and
i
think
my
readers
will
agree
with
me

not
only
that
the
religious


sentiment
is
not
dead
in
france

but
that
it
never
was
more
living
and


more
active
in
france

nor
more
full
of
promise
for
the
social
and


political
regeneration
of
this
great
people






i
shall
not
run
the
risk
of
offending
this
good
catholic
by
naming
him



though
his
name
and
his
work
are
an
open
secret
for
every
intelligent


person
in
lille

suffice
it
that

coming
of
an
old
flemish
stock
and


bearing
an
old
flemish
name

this
citizen

the
title
of
citizen
means


something
respectable
in
these
staunch
old
free
cities

of
lille
years


ago
insisted
to
his
brother

who
was
his
associate
in
the
ownership
and


management
of
one
of
the
largest
commercial
houses
of
this
region

that


they
should
take
regularly
into
the
partnership
account
of
their


business

for
one
third
of
their
annual
profits


the
work
of
god


this


was
done

and
from
that
day
to
this
the
proportion
thus
set
apart
of


their
profits
has
been
regularly
devoted
to
the
service
of
the
church


and
of
charity

but
this
is
not
all

the
brother

of
whom
i
speak
with


the
reticence
and
the
reverence
due
to
a
type
of
character
not


absolutely
common
in
this
age
of
the
golden
calf

has
systematically


limited
his
own
personal
expenses
during
the
whole
of
these
years
to
a


few
thousands
of
francs

devoting
all
the
rest
of
his
income
to


religious
and
benevolent
objects






i
should
really
like
to
see
a
calm
business
like
estimate
made
of
the


economical
advantages
likely
to
result
to
a
country
from
extinguishing


at
an
expense
of
several
hundreds
of
millions
of
francs
a
year
the
faith


which
gives
birth
to
characters
such
as
this






i
visited

in
one
of
the
suburbs
of
lille

the
extensive
manufactories


of
another
well
known
house

the
heads
of
which
have
worked
out
and


established
an
excellent
system
of

mutual
assistance

among
their


employees

and
built
up
a
large
and
well
ordered

cite
ouvriere

on
a


plan
substantially
resembling
that
of
those
which
i
saw
at
st

gobain


and
at
anzin

a
house
for
young
girls
established
by
this
firm

very


near
their
main
factory

struck
me
as
particularly
admirable

it
is


under
the
management
of
the
sisters
of
st

vincent
de
paul

who
fill
the


place
with
a
pervading
spirit
of
cheerfulness
and
animation

quite


indescribable

the
dormitories
were
the
perfection
of
neatness

the


gymnastic
hall
and
the
grounds
were
in
apple
pie
order

and
as
the
lower


part
of
the
large
and
airy
building
erected
by
the
firm
for
this


domicile
is
used
during
the
day
as
a
kind
of
creche
by
the
married
women


who
leave
their
young
children
here
while
they
are
busy
in
the
factory



the
whole
place
was
alive
with
merry
and
laughing
little
imps

i
heard


of
other
establishments
of
the
same
kind
at
and
near
roubaix
on
a
still


larger
scale

these
i
unfortunately
had
not
time
to
visit

under
the


empire
in

a
few
energetic
citizens
of
lille
induced
the


municipality
to
guarantee
five
per
cent

interest
on
a
capital
of





francs
for
the
establishment
of
a
company
to
construct

let


and
sell
houses
for
working
men
under
certain
conditions
as
to
the


isolation
of
each
house
and
as
to
its
proper
ventilation
and
drainage



the
rental
of
these
houses
can
never
exceed
eight
per
cent

on
the
cost


of
erection

those
of
one
story
never
to
cost
more
than


francs



and
those
of
two
stories
more
than


francs

including
the
cost
of


the
land

the
houses
are
built
of
brick
with
foundations
and
sills
of


soignies
stone

these
were
the
original
statutes

but
the
company
is
now


allowed
to
build
single
story
houses
on
a
larger
scale
with
cellars



which
may
be
rented
for

francs
a
year
or
bought
for


francs

a


first
payment
in
the
case
of
purchase
to
be
made
of

francs

and


after
that
the
money
to
be
paid
in
instalments
of

francs
a
month
over


thirteen
years

all
the
wells
and
pumps
are
supplied
by
the


municipality






the
municipality
also
makes
an
annual
grant
in
aid
of
a
very
useful


charity

founded
under
the
empire

and
largely
developed
by
private


gifts
and
legacies

called
the

invalids
of
labour


this
now
secures


pensions
to
nearly
a
hundred
workmen

disabled
by
serious
accidents


incurred
in
their
labour
or
through
some
effort
to
help
others
in
peril



it
also
gives
temporary
assistance
in
less
severe
cases

but
the
most


characteristic
institution
which
i
found
flourishing
at
lille
has
a


history
worth
telling

it
strikingly
illustrates
the
development
under


the
old

regime

in
france
and
flanders
of
those
public
works
of


benevolence
of
which
we
are
so
often
and
so
audaciously
asked
to
believe


that
they
had
no
existence
before
the
benign

principles
of




bedewed
the
hearts
of
men

and
it
not
less
strikingly
illustrates
the


demoralising
and
destructive
influence
upon
all
manner
of
sound
and


useful
establishments
throughout
france
of
the
headlong
and
reckless


administration
of
public
affairs
by
the
successive

governments

of
the


first
republic






in
the
year


on
september


a
worthy
catholic
citizen



bartholomew
masurel


bourgeois
et
manant

of
the
city
of
lille

came


before
two
notaries

and
declared

that
to
succour
the
poor
people
of


lille
in
their
necessities

and
also
for
the
salvation
of
his
own
soul


and
the
souls
of
his
predecessors
and
successors

he
wished
to
establish


a

mont
de
piete


where
money
loans
should
be
made
without
usury
or


interest

and
not
as
they
were
made
by
the
lombards







to
this
end
bartholomew
masurel
gave

by
a
donation
between
living


persons

and
irrevocable

to
take
effect
after
his
death

all
his
lands



fiefs

and
houses
which
he
owned
at
lille

and
in
his
country
place

and


the
value
of
which
might
be
estimated
at
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand



livres
parisis


or
in
money
of
our
day
nominally


francs

in


fact

the
gift

i
am
told

represented
about
half
a
million
francs
of


our
days






but
the
good


bourgeois
et
manant


could
not
hold
out
till
his
death


against
the
appeal
which
the
sight
of

the
poor
people
of
lille
in
their


necessities

daily
made
to
his
kindly
heart

so
in

he
agreed
with


the
mayor

that
he
would
turn
over
all
these
possessions
at
once
to
the


magistrates
to
be
applied
to
the
purpose
he
meant
to
effect

the


magistrates
agreeing
to
secure
to
him
an
annuity
out
of
the
funds
of
the


city
of


florins

or
about


francs
of
our
time

thereupon
he


went
to
work
with
the
authorities
to
found
his
charity

from
his


statutes
we
learn
that
foundations
of
this
kind
were
then
common
in


french
flanders

he
models
them

as
he
says

upon

those
of
similar


foundations
in
our
neighbouring
towns
and
elsewhere







no
loans
were
to
be
made
except
to


manants
et
habitants
de
la
ville


taille
et
banlieue
de
lille



and
only
to

poor
and
necessitous
persons


who

not
being
able
to
gain
their
livelihood

were
forced
to
borrow


money


nor
were
loans
to
be
made
to

persons
prodigal

of
evil
life



and
accustomed
to
squander
their
goods


for
this
due
order
was
to
be


taken
by
the
magistrates

at
first
the
loans
were
limited
to

florins




francs

to
one
person

the
lowest
sum
loaned
being

patars

or



fr


c

of
our
times

so
well
had
bartholomew
masurel
organised
his


charity

and
so
many
good
christian
souls
swelled
its
funds
by
gifts
and


bequests

that
within
a
year
the
maximum
loan
was
raised
to

florins



in

to

florins

and
in

it
was
fixed
at

florins

or



francs

at
this
figure
it
stood
when
the
first
republic
began
its


experiments

the
fund
was
then
known
as

the
true
mont
de
piete


and


was
carried
on
under
letters
patent
granted
in

by
the
archduke


albert
of
austria

when
lille
became
french
in


louis
xiv
had
to


recognise
and
confirm
all
the
rights
and
titles
of
this
benevolent


institution






it
had
rendered
great
service
to
the
industries
of
lille
during
the


seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries

the
growth
of
the
funds
enabling


the
managers
to
lend
sums
to
weavers
on
their
goods
when
trade
fell
off



and
so
relieving
them
from
the
necessity
of
parting
with
them
for
less


than
their
value

just
before
the
revolution
the
masurel
fund
amounted


to


francs

of
which


francs
were
in
cash
or
in
loans

and


the
rest
in
state
funds
and
houses

yielding
a
revenue
of


francs






on
january




the
national
convention
coolly
ordered
that
all



objects
of
necessity
deposited
in
any
mont
de
piete
for
an
amount
not


exceeding

francs
should
be
at
once
restored
without
payment
to
their


owners

and
all
such
objects
deposited
for
amounts
below

and
above



francs
on
payment

without
interest

of
the
amount
beyond

francs







this

liberal

legislation
had
been
preceded
on
august




by


another
act
of
spoliation
which
ordered

the
payment
of
the
capital
of


all
sums
at
interest
to
be
made
in

assignats


and
the
conversion
of


all
the
debts
of
the
communes

and
of
the
suppressed
public


organisations
throughout
france
into
state
debts






in
consequence
of
these
measures
the
whole
property
of
the
masurel
fund


was
found
in


when
napoleon
began
to
overhaul
the
chaos
to
which


the
lunatics
and
plunderers
of
the
republic
had
reduced
france

to


amount
to
no
more
than


francs
in
real
estate

this
was
the
way
in


which
the

principles
of


developed
the
benevolent
institutions
of


france

and
introduced
a
new
era






the
authorities
of
lille
had
the
good
sense
and
forecast
thereupon
to


suspend
the
operations
of
the
true

mont
de
piete


and
to
set
about


restoring
the
fund
as
far
and
as
fast
as
was
possible

the
christian


institution
of
masurel
had
fared
better
than
the

lombards


this
latter


establishment
had
to
be
formally
closed
in


as
it
was
then
found
to


have
no
more
than


francs
in
its
treasury

and
this
in



assignats







in

the
prefect
of
the
nord
reported
that
the
masurel
fund
might
be


safely
devoted
anew
to
the
purposes
of
its
founder

it
then
amounted
to




fr

by
an
imperial
decree
of


all
that
remained
of
the


property
of
the

lombards

was
amalgamated
with
the
masurel
fund

and


the
institution
was
put
under
the
direction
of
the
official


mont
de
piete
of
lille

but
with
a
separate
system
of
accounts

and


began
its
operations
again
on
the
lines
laid
down
by
its
founder
in




it
has
since
worked
so
well
that
the
maximum
of
the
loans


reimbursable

without
interest

has
risen
from

francs
in

to



francs






in


the
maximum
being

francs

the
number
of
engagements
and


renewals
was



the
money
loaned
amounted
to

averaging

the
capital

of
the

similar
foundations
in
other
towns

which
moved
the
pious


emulation
of
bartholomew
masurel
nearly
three
centuries
ago

how
many

i


wonder

still
exist






and
with
them
how
many
other
monuments
of
the
christian
civilisation
of


flanders
and
of
france
were

improved

off
the
face
of
the
earth
by
the



regenerators

of







it
was
not
by
accident
that
i
learned
of
the
masurel
mont
de
piete

but


when
i
went
to
the
municipal
secretary
to
ask
him
for
some
official


account
of
its
condition
and
its
operation

that
courteous
functionary


looked
at
me
for
a
moment
with
astonishment
and
then
said


i
am


delighted
to
give
you
what
you
want

and
i
assure
you
that

with
one


exception

you
are
the
only
foreigner
who
has
ever
asked
for
this


information
in
the
last
seven
years

the
other
was
the
english


protestant
clergyman
here
in
lille

who
happens
to
live
or
has
his


chapel

i
am
not
sure
which

just
opposite
the
mont
de
piete







i
ought
not
to
speak
however
of
the
masurel
foundation
as

unique


i


hope
there
may
be
many
more
men
like
the
good
bartholomew
masurel
in
our


time

and
in
other
countries
besides
france

than
we
wot
of

but
the


only
modern
institution
of
a
kindred
spirit
with
this
of
which
i
have


any
present
cognisance
began
its
career
in
england
only
fifteen
years


ago

and
was
founded
curiously
enough
like
the
masurel
fund
by
men
of


the
low
countries

this
is
the

koning
willem
s
fonds


of
the


netherlands
benevolent
society
of
london

at
a
dinner
given
at
the


cannon
street
hotel
on
may




to
celebrate
the
twenty
fifth
year


of
the
accession
of
king
william
iii
under
the
presidency
of
the
dutch


minister
in
england

the
count
de
bylandt

the
guests
in
a
glow
of


loyalty
and
good
fellowship
proposed
to
raise
a
contribution
to
be
spent


in
the
purchase
of
some
handsome
memorial
of
the
occasion

a
happy


inspiration
came
to
the
chairman

and
he
suggested
to
his
countrymen


that
the
best
of
all
possible
memorials
of
such
an
occasion
would
be
to


establish
a
fund
for
the
relief
of
poor
and
worthy
netherlanders
in


london
and
to
give
it
the
name
of
their
king

the
suggestion
was
adopted


by
acclamation

and
the
result
the

koning
willem
s
fonds


from
which



as
i
find
by
examining
its
statutes
and
its
records

gratuitous
loans



precisely
identical
in
their
object
and
under
conditions
not
essentially


different

are
made
to
deserving
hollanders
in
london






the

fonds

is
connected
with
a
society
doing
the
usual
work
of
all
such


foreign
benevolent
societies
in
london

but
it
is
a
special
fund

and
as


i
learn
from
the
annual
report
of
the
society
for
january


it
has


so
far
been
administered
with
entire
success

and
with
the
result
of


enabling
not
a
few
honest
and
industrious
hollanders
stranded
in
london


to
make
a
fair
and
prosperous
start
in
life

that
the
fund
is


administered
in
the
true
practical
spirit
of
the
old
low
country


benevolence

and
its
advantages
appreciated
as
they
ought
to
be

appears


from
the
statement
made
by
the
treasurer

mr

maas

in
the
report
for




that
the
number
of
loans
is
increasing
and
the
number
of
donations


decreasing

in


l


were
loaned
as
against

l


in


and



l


given
away
as
against

l


in


i
observe

too

that
the


lord
mayor
of
london

sir
polydore
de
keyser

gave
at
this
annual


meeting
as
his
reason
for
joining
the
society
which
administers
this


fund
that
it
had
the
courage
to
spend

l


in
excess
of
its
assured


income
rather
than
send
away
the
good
which
came
to
its
door
to
be


done

no
city
in
france
has
more
to
lose
and
less
to
gain
from
the
triumph
of


the
third
republic
over
historic
france
than
this
ancient

rich

and


royal
city
of
reims






the
triumph
of
the
third
republic
on
the
lines
laid
down
by
m



challemel
lacour
in

and
re
affirmed
at
the
elections
of


means


the
extinction
of
the
religious
sentiment
in
france

to
extinguish
the


religious
sentiment
in
france
would
be
to
empty
the
history
of
reims
of


all
its
significance

it
would
be
to
filch
from
the
city
of
st

remi
and


of
clovis

of
urban
ii

and
of
jeanne
d
arc

its
great
name

a
robbery


that
surely
would
not
enrich
the
third
republic

but
that
would
leave


reims
poor
indeed






of
course
it
is
possible
that
the
laicised

unbaptized

and
atheistic


french
citizen
of
the
future
may
come
to
regard
the
hegira
of
m



gambetta
from
paris
to
tours
in
a
balloon

and
the
occupation
of
tonkin



as
events
of
greater
importance
to
mankind
than
the
creation
of

by
clotilde
and
clovis

or
the
rescue
of

from
conquest
and


dismemberment
by
the
pious
peasant
girl
of

or
the
rolling
back


of
islam
from
the
domination
of

by

ii

heaven
forbid


that
i
should
assume
to
set
any
limit
to
the
things
which
a
truly


scientific
unbeliever
is
likely
to
believe






but
while
men
still
abide
in
the
thick
darkness
of
the
catholic
faith



or
even
in
the
penumbral
twilight
of
protestant
christianity

i
do
not


see
how
reims
is
to
be
one
bit
the
better

materially
or
morally

for


the
extinction
of
the
religious
sentiment
in
france






the
arrondissement
of
reims
contains
very
nearly


people

of
whom


considerably
more
than
one
third
inhabit
the
city
itself

a
very
large


proportion
of
these
are
employed
in
the
numerous
factories
which


flourish
here

and
many
more
in
the
various
industries
connected
with


the
incessantly
growing
commerce
in
those
sparkling
wines
which
have


made
the
name
of
this
ancient
province
synonymous
with
luxury
and
gaiety


in
the
remotest
corners
of
the
world

though
epernay
is
the
real


headquarters
of
this
commerce

two
or
three
of
the
most
important
houses


connected
with
it
are

and
long
have
been

established
at
reims

and


some
of
the
most
remarkable
of
the
vast
cellars
excavated
in
the
chalk



in
which
these
sparkling
wines
are
stored
throughout
the
department
of


the
marne

are
here
to
be
seen

here
too

at
least
as
well
as
at
epernay


or
chalons

acquaintance
may
be
made

at
the
right
time
and
in
the
right


places

with
certain
vintages
of
champagne
which
seldom
or
never
find


their
way
into
the
channels
of
trade

not
so
much
because
of
their


rarity
and
high
cost
as
because
of
their
exceeding
delicacy

it
is


almost
impossible

for
example

to
find
even
at
paris
the
finest
quality


of
the
red

vin
de
cave

of
bouzy

this
is
illustrated
by
the
fact
that


the
only
samples
of
this
exquisite
wine
sent
to
paris
for
the
universal


exposition
of

were
those
sent
by
bouche
fils
at
mareuil
sur
ay

and


these
represented
only
three
vintages

the
earliest
being
that
of




the
daintily
aromatic
bouquet
of
this
wine
is
seldom
unaffected
even
by


the
short
railway
journey
to
the
capital

of
course
i
know
that
by


speaking
of
this
or
of
any
other
still
wine
of
champagne

i
put
myself


under
the
ban
of
mr

canning
s
famous
declaration

so
often
cited
by


lord
beaconsfield

that

the
man
who
says
he
likes
still
champagne
will


say
anything


nevertheless
what
i
have
written

i
have
written

and
i


shall
not
take
it
back

this
the
less

that
i
cannot
allow
myself
even


to
enter
upon
this
theme
of
the
vineyards
of
the
chalky
marne
and
the


cellars
of
champagne

were
i
to
do
this

i
should
have
a
tale
to
unfold



much
too
long

and
involving
too
many
points
of
controversy
with
the


accepted
gastronomic
authorities
in
my
own
country

in
england

and
in


russia

to
be
brought
within
the
compass
of
this
volume

suffice
it
that


the
great
wine
growers
of
champagne
do
not
seem
to
me
to
be
infidels

or


to
neglect
the
due
provision
of
their
own
households
in
their


philanthropic
anxiety
to
promote
the
convivial
happiness
of
the
four


quarters
of
the
globe

the
extent
to
which
the
syndication
of
vineyards


for
the
production
of
the
wines
most
in
demand
in
one
or
another
part
of


the
world

has
been
developed
of
late
years
in
champagne
is
a
noteworthy


phenomenon

not
less
noteworthy
is
the
growing
attention
paid
throughout


this
department
of
the
marne
of
late
years
to
scientific
methods
in


agriculture

and
the
steady
improvement
in
the
condition
of
the
rural


population






whether
a
similar
improvement
can
be
shown
in
the
general
condition
of


the
urban
population
is
not
so
clear
as
might
be
wished

that
within


certain
limits
such
an
improvement
has
taken
place

is
however


undeniable

and
this
is
of
great
interest

because
it
is
distinctly
due


to
the
energy
and
decision
with
which
the
challenge
flung
down
to
the


christianity
of
this
historic
christian
heart
of
france
has
been
taken


up
by
the
catholics
of
reims






in
the
course
of
a
most
interesting
visit
which
i
made
in
august
to
the


cardinal
archbishop
of
reims

his
eminence
was
good
enough
to
put
me
in


the
way
of
measuring
for
myself
the
work
done
among
the
factory
people


of
this
region
by
a
great
christian
organization

the
centre
and
pivot


of
which
was
established
here

but
which
is
mow
extending
itself
all


over
the
country

most
assuredly
there
is
nothing
in
the
story
of
this


work
to
indicate
either
the
approaching
death
or
the
decay
of
the


religious
sentiment
in
france






this
work
rests

like
all
great
works

upon
certain
principles

but


these
principles
were
worked
out

not
through
any
theoretical


inquisition
into
the
possibilities
of
society

but
through
a
direct


personal
practical
experience
of
the
relations
between
an
employer
of


labour
and
his
employees

it
is
known
now
throughout
france
as
the
work


of
the

christian
corporations


and
it
includes

as
a
part
of
its


machinery

the

catholic
workmen
s
clubs


which
are
increasing
and


multiplying
throughout
france

its
founder

m

leon
harmel

is
at
the


head
of
an
important
manufactory
at
the
val
des
bois
near
reims

this


manufactory
was
established
here
half
a
century
ago
by
the
father
of
m



harmel

and
the
great
social
work
which
the
son
is
now
doing
is
the


coming
to
fruit

after
many
years

of
the
virtues
and
the
experience
of


his
father

the
ardennes
is
the
northernmost
of
the
four
departments


into
which
the
wise
men
of

divided
the
ancient
province
of


champagne

and
m

harmel

the
father

had
inherited
a
manufactory
in


that
department

this
he
gave
up
to
his
brother

and
removing
to
the


marne
in

he
founded
here
the
establishment
of
the
val
des
bois

he


was
a
devout
and
sincere
catholic

and
he
had
lived
all
his
life
among
a


quiet
and
catholic
population
in
the
ardennes

he
found
himself


surrounded
in
his
new
home
by
a
totally
different
people

his
new


employees
were
amazed
when
they
saw
him
attending
mass
at
the
parish


church
on
sunday

a
few
of
their
wives
and
daughters
went
there


irregularly

but
the
men

as
a
rule

were

total
abstainers







m

harmel
made
no
attempt
to
preach
to
his
people
otherwise
than
by
his


example

but
the
employer
being
regarded

in
the
light
of
modern


progress

as
the
natural
enemy
of
the
employee

this
example
had
little


effect

m

leon
harmel
tells
a
delightful
story
of
his
father
s
first


success
in
inducing
some
of
his
workmen

with
whom
he
had
fallen


incidentally
into
conversation
on
the
subject

to
go
over
to
reims
in


the
early
morning
at
the
beginning
of
lent

and
confess
to
an
excellent


priest
there
who
was
one
of
his
friends

he
spake
with
the
men


separately

and
said
nothing
to
any
one
of
them
of
his
conversations


with
the
others

meeting
one
of
his
converts
on
his
return

m

harmel


asked
him
about
his
experience


ah

sir


the
man
replied


it
is
all


very
well

but
i
shall
never
be
caught
there
again



and

pray

why


not



why
i
thought
i
was
the
only
man
going
to
confess

i
saw
no
one


when
i
went
into
the
confessional

and
the
good
priest
was
very
good



and
i
was
glad
i
went

but
when
i
came
to
commune
in
the
church

there


were
three
of
my
comrades

how
i
looked
at
them

and
how
they
looked
at


me

it
will
be
all
over
the
factory
to
night

and
we
four
will
have
no


peace
for
six
months

no

i
shall
not
do
this
again







the
manufactory
prospered

if
the
example
of
m

harmel
availed
little


against
the
public
sentiment
of
the
workpeople
educated
in
utter


indifference
to
all
religion

in
the
way
of
inducing
them
to
attend
to


their
religious
duties

his
unvarying
justice
and
benevolence

his


readiness
to
succour
and
to
advise
them
in
all
straits

and
his


unobtrusive
devotion
to
his
faith

at
least
exerted
a
wholesome
effect


upon
their
general
conduct

and
the
factory
of
the
val
des
bois
earned


a
high
reputation
for
its
freedom
from
flagrant
scandals
and
disorders



but
this
did
not
satisfy
m

harmel

after
twenty
years
of
single
handed


and
uphill
work

he
determined
to
seek
help

on
february




he


established
three
sisters
of
st

vincent
de
paul
in
a
small
house
which


had
been
a
wayside
inn

and
set
about
christianising
his
people
in


earnest

there
was
no
pomp
or
parade
about
the
matter

the
good
sisters


were
quite
content
to
establish
an
asylum
for
the
little
children
in


what
had
been
the
stable
of
the
inn

and
to
open
their
school
in
two


little
upper
chambers

two
jesuit
fathers
came
and
devoted
a
month
to
a


regular
mission

processions
were
organised
and
lectures
given

some
in


the
factory

others
at
the
little
inn

the
novelty
of
the
enterprise


excited
the
attention
of
the
people

and
when
a
decided
movement
at
last


of
interest
in
the
mission
made
itself
clearly
felt

m

harmel
took


advantage
of
it

with
the
help
of
the
sisters

to
form
christian


associations

first
among
the
young
girls

then
among
the
young
men

and


then
among
the
workmen
themselves

the
first
young
girl
who
gave
an


effectual
impulse
to
the
work

was
a
girl
selected
by
the
sisters

with


their
usual
sound
instinct

because
they
found
her
capable
of
absolute


devotion
to
a
not
by
any
means
estimable
mother

and
to
a
decidedly


reprehensible
sister

she
was
a
peasant
girl

brought
up
in
a
disorderly


family

by
no
means
choice
or
refined
in
her
language

but
the
sisters



for
whom
she
conceived
a
great
affection

saw
that
she
was
generous



fearless

and
determined

and
that
was
enough






with
the
girls

with
the
young
men

with
the
workmen

no
sort
of
direct


or
indirect
pressure
was
ever
for
a
moment
employed

the
associations


which
they
formed
were
managed
by
themselves

m

harmel

the
priest
whom


he
finally
brought
to
val
des
bois

and
for
whom
he
built
a
chapel

and


the
missionary
brethren

giving
advice
and
aid
only
when
and
as
it
was


asked

one
excellent
workman

who
had
been
in
the
factory
for
many


years

and
who
was
much
esteemed
by
m

harmel

was
asked
one
day
by
the


priest
why
he
had
never
taken
any
interest
in
the
religious


associations


i
do
take
an
interest
in
them


he
replied


and
they
are


doing
a
great
deal
of
good

i
don
t
feel
moved
to
join
them

but
i
do


them
a
great
service
often

many
a
time
in
the
cabarets
i
hear
a
man


say


oh

the
papa
harmel
is
a
good
man

no
doubt

they
are
right
to


call
him
there

the
good
father


he
is
all
that

but
nobody
can
get
any


work
there
unless
he
is
a
little
saint


then
i
get
up
and
say


don
t


talk
like
a
fool

you
see
me

i
have
worked
for

the
good
father



thirty
five
years

i
have
never
done
my
religious
duties

but
nobody


treats
me
the
worse
for
that

that
shuts
them
up








one
great
obstacle

at
the
outset

to
the
success
of
these
associations



out
of
which
the

christian
corporations

were
eventually
to
grow

was


the
hostility
of
the
elder
married
women
to
the

enfans
de
marie


and


the
other
societies
of
young
girls

they
objected
that
these
societies


broke
up
the
sunday
balls

and
when
they
were
asked
whether
these
sunday


balls
did
not
lead
to
a
good
many
scandals

they
replied


oh

young


people
must
amuse
themselves

we
used
to
amuse
ourselves


they
insisted


too

that
the
girls
would
neglect
their
home
duties
to
attend
mass
and


the
meetings
of
their
new
societies

one
particularly
recalcitrant
dame


made
her
husband
s
life
a
burden
to
him

because
he
not
only
encouraged


his
daughters
in
going
to
the
sisters

but
actually
went
to
mass


himself

finally

one
day
the
poor
man
came
to
see
the
sisters

he
was


evidently
much
exercised
in
his
mind

and
showing
the
sisters
a
small


sum
of
money
he
had

he
said


i
have
saved
this
up
to
bring
my
old


woman
to
a
better
mind

and
i
want
you
to
help
me


they
asked
him
how




why

you
see

all
the
trouble
comes
because
she
don
t
know
you

and


won
t
know
you

and
thinks
everything
wrong
about
you

now
if
one
of
you


will
just
take
this
money

and
buy
her
a
new
sunday
gown

and
take
it
to


her
as
if
it
was
a
gift
you
wanted
to
make
her

that
will
bring
her
all


right

i
know

and
we
shall
have
peace
in
the
house







what
sister
could
resist
such
an
appeal

the
pious
fraud
was


perpetrated

and
the
worthy
dame
gave
way
along
the
whole
line






this
working
population
of
val
des
bois

when
m

harmel
began
his
work


among
them

it
will
be
seen

was
a
fair
type
of
the
average
working


populations
of
france
in
those
parts
of
france
where
the
influence
of


radicalism
has
been
most
potent

and
the
influence
of
the
church


weakest

there
is
another
factory
in
the
same
commune
now

there
are


sixteen
others
within
a
radius
of
three
french
leagues

and
the
city
of


reims

with
its
population
of
nearly
a
hundred
thousand
souls

is
within


half
an
hour
of
the
place

all
the
disturbing
currents
of
socialism

of


agrarianism

of
indifferentism
play
about
and
upon
the
place
constantly



the
sunday
ball
is
an
institution
still

the
influence
of
the
local


authorities
during
the
last
ten
years
has
been
thrown
against
the


catholic
associations

and
therefore

from
the
nature
of
the
case

in


favour
of
dissipation

debauchery

and
disorder






to
see
his
work
prosper
in
a
soil
so
unpropitious
and
amid
such
hostile


circumstances
might
well
have
quickened
the
faith
of
a
man
much
colder


and
more
sceptical
than
m

harmel






in


as
i
have
said

not
one
workman
could
be
found
at
val
des
bois


who
dared
to
go
to
mass

in


at
the
request
of
forty
of
his


workmen

m

harmel
assisted
them
in
drawing
up
the
statutes
and


arranging
the
programme
of
a
catholic
working
men
s
club

the
initiative


came
from
them

no
pressure
of
any
sort
or
kind
was
put
upon
them
to


take
it

it
was
the
free
outcome
of
the
influence
exerted
upon
them
by


the
example
of
the
harmel
family
and
by
the
religious
and
charitable


work
which
the
sisters
and
the
priests
had
been
doing
at
val
des
bois



within
a
year
the
club
doubled
its
membership

when
the
invasion
came



in


it
was
an
established
institution







m

harmel
planted
his
christians
at
val
des
bois


said
to
me
one
of


the
most
interesting
men
i
met
at
reims


as
our
vine
growers
in


champagne
plant
their
vines

it
is
one
of
the
mysteries
of
our


viticulture
that
the
grapes
which
yield
our
most
delicate
and
exquisite


wines
of
ay

all
sparkle
and
sunshine

can
only
be
made
to
yield
those


wines
when
they
are
planted
in
our
poorest
and
most
chalky
soil

and
in


regions
where
the
climate
is
so
ungenial
that
the
plants
have
to
be
set


as
closely
as
possible
together
in
the
ground

we
really
huddle
them


together

as
we
do
sheep
in
the
hurdles
in
winter

to
keep
one
another


warm

this
m

harmel
did
with
his
converts

he
taught
his
workmen
to


associate
more
closely
with
one
another

he
brought
their
minds
and


their
hearts
together

and
let
them
act
one
upon
another

he
lived
and


moved
and
had
his
own
being
among
them
like
a
father

and
in
this
way


insensibly
they
came
by
degrees
to
regard
each
other
as
members
of
a


family

he
has
always
felt

and
his
whole
life
has
shown
it

that
the



declaration
of
the
rights
of
man


whatever
the
motives
of
its
authors


may
have
been

put
the
weak
of
this
world
at
the
mercy
of
the
strong



and
set
capital
free
to
deal
with
labour
as
a
mere
matter
of
bargain


and
sale

the
dominant
idea
in
his
mind
has
always
been

as
it
was
in


the
mind
of
his
father
before
him

the

good
father

of


val
des
bois

not
how
to
get
the
most
work
out
of
his
workmen

but
how


best
to
do
his
own
duty
to
his
workmen

thinking
that
the
best
way
to


get
them

on
their
part

to
do
their
duty
to
him

all
this

you
see

is


quite
mediaeval
and
christian

not
in
the
least
modern
and
scientific



but
has
the
modern
and
scientific
way
of
looking
at
the
relations
of


capital
and
labour

so
far

been
what
may
be
called
a
great
success

do


we
seem
to
be
in
the
way
of
organizing
a
solid
modern
society
on
the


principles
of
the

struggle
for
life

and
of
the

survival
of
the


fittest


certainly
these
principles
are
a
logical
outcome
of
the



declaration
of
the
rights
of
man


and
of
such
legislation
as
that


which
in

shattered
to
pieces
at
a
blow
the
whole
ancient
and


christian
organization
of
industry
in
our
unhappy
land
of
france

as


certainly
too

they
are
admirably
fitted
to
secure
either
the
complete


subjugation
of
labour
by
capital
or
the
relapse
of
france
and
of
europe


into
barbarism

is
not
universal
suffrage
a
natural
and
easy
weapon
of


capital
in
any

struggle
for
life

with
labour

is
it
not
clear
that

in


losing
the
notion
of
duty
to
his
employer

the
workman
has
necessarily


lost
the
idea
also
of
duty
to
his
fellow
workmen


every
man
for


himself

is
the
motto
of
modern
democracy

and
do
we
not
see
that
the


syndicates
of
workmen
which
it
was
the
object
of
the
radicals
to


establish
by
their
law
of
march

concerning

professional


syndicates


in
order
to
facilitate
and
promote

strikes


are
only
kept


together
and
made
to
work
by
sheer
terrorism

what
is
the
sanction
of


the
measures
ordered
by
such
syndicates
excepting
the
fear
in
which


every
member
goes
of
his
fellow
members

does
not
that
take
us
a
long


way
on
towards
savage
life

does
not
that
tend
directly
to
build
up
a


subterranean
machinery
of
despotism
which
will
be
at
the
service
of
the


shrewdest
head
and
the
longest
purse
whenever
any
real
and
decisive


issue
arises
between
organised
capital
and
organised
labour







look
at
the
part
which
money
played
in
our
first
unhappy
revolution







it
is
the
most
instructive
part
of
that
whole
sad
history

and
yet

for


a
hundred
different
reasons

it
is
the
part
which
from
the
beginning
has


been
most
obscured
by
a
miscellaneous
conspiracy
of
silence

some
day


perhaps
it
will
be
possible
to
get
a
true
life
written
of
le
pelletier


de
saint
fargeau

the
millionaire
mephistopheles
of
philippe
egalite



the
hand
that
struck
him
to
death
in
the
very
centre
of
the
scene
of
his


long
machinations

there
in
the
palais
royal

with
his
vote

dooming
the


king
to
death

still
as
it
were
on
his
lips

did
not
strike
at
random



there
was
no
such
bit
of
dramatic
justice
done
in
those
dark
days
as
the


killing
of
that
man
in
that
place
between
the
giving
of
that
vote
and


the
murder
of
the
king
that
followed
it
next
day







but
the
story
cannot
be
written
yet

they
were
much
more
concerned


about
the
death
of
le
pelletier
next
day
in
the
convention

you
will
see


if
you
look
into
the
true
records
of
the
session

than
they
were
about


the
murder
of
the
king

which
was
then
going
on
in
the
place
de
la


revolution

they
gave
him

why
not



the
most
active
of
them
and
the


deepest
in
the
plot
were
his
property

bought
and
paid
for


they
gave


him
a
national
funeral

and
made
his
heiress

the
greatest
heiress
she


was
in
france

the
ward
of
the
nation







it
was
quite
another
vision
he
had
in
his
mind
for
her

i
will
show
you


some
day
a
curious
letter
of
hers
written
after
she
became
a
duchess



about
the
empress
josephine

it
is
very
instructive

she
grew
up
a


lovely

untameable

unmanageable
young
person

made
a
love
match

as
you


know

and
with
whom
you
know

broke
her
husband
s
heart

got
a
divorce


and
married
again

to
go
into
all
this
now
would
disturb
the
peace
of


families
in
no
way
responsible
for
her
career
or
for
the
plots
and


schemes
of
her
father

it
would
be
like

flushing

the
ghost
of
that


monster
carrier
who
drowned
the
poor
and
the
priests
at
nantes

only
to


plague
his
descendants

his
son
was
an
excellent
person
who
very


properly
changed
his
name

the
most
malicious
thing
i
ever
knew
one


woman
say
of
another

was
said
of
one
of
his
grand
daughters
at
a


foreign
court
by
another
frenchwoman

jealous
of
her
social
success




she
is
very
charming

no
doubt

but
look
at
her
mouth

and
you
will
see


she
has
carious
teeth


des
dents
carrier



but
when

if
ever

the


truth
about
that
dark
episode
of
le
pelletier
and
his
schemes
is
told



it
will
be
seen
how
much
more
gold
and
private
ambitions
had
to
do
with


the
final
fatal
drift
of
things
after
the
destiny
of
france
fell
into


the
swirl
of
paris

than
all
the
howlings
and
ravings
of
the


philosophers
and
the
patriots

what
happened
in
the
last
century
will


happen
again
whenever
and
wherever
human
society
ceases
to
be
held


together
by
the
idea
of
duty

it
is
not
the
discontent
of
labour
which


makes
me
most
anxious
as
to
the
future

it
is
the
egotism
of
capital



educated
and
encouraged
into
egotism
by
the
false
doctrines
of
what
is


called
liberalism
in
this
country

and
provoked
into
egotism
by
the


equally
egotistic
discontent
of
labour

what
i
most
value
in
the
work
of


m

harmel
is
the
courage
and
precision
with
which
he
has
from
the
first


insisted
upon
the
duty
of
the
employer
to
the
employed

you
have
seen



of
course

his

catechisme
du
patron








the
cardinal
archbishop
had
given
me
a
copy
of
this
book

which
is


really
one
of
the
most
remarkable
contributions
ever
made
to
the


practical
study
of
the
relations
between
capital
and
labour

in
it
m



harmel
has
condensed

in
the
catechetical
form
of
questions
and
answers



his
lifelong
experience
in
the
work
of
ascertaining
and
fulfilling
all


the
duties
incumbent

from
the
point
of
view
of
christian
duty

upon
the


capitalist
who
employs
the
labour
of
his
fellow
men
in
putting
his


capital
into
use
and
making
it
profitable

it
would
be
very
interesting


merely
as
a
theory
of
the
true
relations
between
labour
and
capital

it


is
more
than
interesting
as
the
ripe
expression
of
an
experiment


faithfully
and
successfully
carried
out
by
a
man
of
resolute
will
and


great
practical
ability
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
in
a
field


which

when
he
entered
upon
it

was
certainly
one
of
the
most


unpromising
in
the
world






the

christian
corporation

was
an
established
institution

as
i
have


said

at
val
des
bois

in


when
the
war
with
germany
broke
out

in




after
the
storm
of
the
invasion
had
been
followed
by
the
horrors


of
the
commune
of
paris

the
principles
on
which
the
industrial
family


at
val
des
bois
had
been
organised
began
to
attract
attention
all
over


france

a
club
of
catholic
working
men
was
opened
at
paris
in


and


a
movement
began
in
earnest
for
extending
these
institutions
throughout


france

it
made
rapid
progress

in
september

a
great
disaster


occurred
at
val
des
bois

the
factory
buildings
took
fire
during
the


night
of
the
th
of
that
month

and
despite
the
efforts
of
the
whole


population
they
were
all
in
ashes
when
the
morning
broke

before
noon
of


the
next
day
m

harmel
announced
to
his
workmen
that
he
had
leased

at


no
small
sacrifice
of
his
immediate
pecuniary
interests

another
factory


at
some
distance
from
the
val
des
bois

called
la
neuville

and
that
the



christian
corporation

of
val
des
bois
might
at
once
be
transferred


thither

and
carried
on
as
before
until
the
reconstruction
of
its


original
site

the
tidings
of
this
calamity
brought
substantial
succour


from
catholic
clubs
all
over
france

from
marseilles
to
nantes

and
from


bordeaux
to
lille

more
than
a
hundred
clubs
were
represented
in
this


outburst
of
sympathy

and
the
disaster
led

not
indirectly

to
a
formal


approval
of
the
work
in
a
brief
issued
by
his
holiness
pius
ix

on


october









in

there
were
more
than
four
hundred
clubs
in
france

with
a


membership
of
nearly
a
hundred
thousand
persons

concurrently
with
the


development
of
these
clubs
a
movement
went
on
for
establishing
an


organisation
of
honorary
members

not
belonging
to
the
working
classes



who
should
co
operate
with
the
clubs
in
promoting
the
principles


represented
by
the

christian
corporations


in

a
parliamentary


inquiry
was
made
into
the
condition
of
labour
in
france

and
on
behalf


of
the
committee
which
conducted
this
inquiry

the
deputy

m

ducarre



who
drew
up
the
report

declared
it
to
be
the
opinion
of
the
committee


that
all
the
syndicating
movements
of
modern
times
point
to
the


necessity
of
re
establishing
the
corporate
system
of
labour
which
was


destroyed
by
the
first
republic
in


the
language
used
in
this


report
is
worth
citing







all
the
remedies
suggested
for
the
existing
state
of
things


said
m



ducarre


may
be
summed
up
in
this
conclusion

there
must
be
an
end
of


the
isolation
of
the
individual
labourer

this
must
be
replaced
by
the


action
of
collectivities

associations

or
syndicates

whose
duty
it


shall
be
to
watch
over
the
interests
of
every
calling

in
a
word
we
must


go
back
to
the
system
of
corporations
of
the
trades


maitrises


and



jurandes


under
which
labour
was
so
long
carried
on
in
france


this


report
found
no
favour
in
the
eyes
of
the
radicals
because
it
aimed
at
a


good
understanding
and
practical
co
operation
between
labour
and


capital

nine
years
afterwards

on
march




a
law
was
carried


through
the
french
parliament
authorising
the
establishment
of



professional
syndicates


the
object
of
the
republicans

then
as
now


controlling
a
majority
of
the
chamber

in
passing
this
law

was
to


strengthen
the
trades
unions
as
against
the
employers
of
france

the


law

it
will
be
observed

was
passed
at
the
time
when
a
syndicate
of


miners
in
the
north

which
had
no
legal
right
to
exist
before
the


passage
of
the
law

was
actively
promoting

under
its
leader

m

basly



the
great
strike
at
anzin
of
which
i
have
spoken
in
a
preceding
chapter



but
while
the
law
of
march

legalised

syndicates

of
this


aggressive

and
in
the
nature
of
things
tyrannical

type

it
also


necessarily
legalised
precisely
such
christian
corporations
as
those


contemplated
in
the
report
of


and
long
before
organised
on
the


lines
laid
down
by
m

harmel

a
great
and
visible
responsibility
was


thus
thrown
upon
the
employers
of
france
and
upon
what
are
called
the


upper
classes
generally
in
that
country

it
was
clear
that

if
they


would
energetically
and
systematically
throw
themselves
into
the
work
of


bringing
about
a
reconstruction
of
social
order
on
the
principles
of


co
operation
and
sympathy
as
opposed
to
the
principle
of
antagonism


between
capital
and
labour

the
law
of


intended
to
widen

might
be


effectually
used
to
close
the
threatening
breach
between
the
employers


and
the
employed

there
seems
to
be
little
doubt
that
down
to
that
time


the
promoters
of
the
christian
corporation
movement
in
france
had
made


greater
headway
with
the
working
classes
than
with
the
employers

a


report
presented
in

by
the
general
committee
of
the
catholic
clubs


of
france
to
the
french
bishops
states
this
very
plainly

this
report


was
signed
by
the
marquis
de
la
tour
du
pin
chambly

who
from
the


beginning
of
m

harmel
s
experiment
at
val
des
bois
had
been
one
of
his


most
earnest
and
active
coadjutors

by
the
comte
de
la
bouillerie



treasurer
of
the
general
society

by
the
comte
de
mun

and
by
the
comte


albert
de
mun

the
moving
spirit
now
of
the
whole
work

who
resigned
his


commission
in
the
army
to
devote
himself
to
it

and
who
went
up
from
the


morbihan
to
paris
as
a
deputy
in


elected
by


votes

to


demand
not
only
the
restoration
of
the
monarchy
but
a
property


restriction
upon
the
suffrage

in


under
the

scrutin


d
arrondissement

readopted
by
the
terrified
republicans
to
defeat



boulangism


count
albert
de
mun
was
re
elected
without
opposition
for


the
nd
division
of
pontivy

in
no
part
of
france
is
the
passion
of


equality
stronger
than
in
the
morbihan

and
the
contempt
of
the
people


there
for

universal
suffrage

is
extremely
instructive







of
the
christian
corporations


says
this
report
of



as
of
the


working
men
s
clubs

it
is
proper
to
say
that
never
in
any
place
or
at


any
time
has
any
obstacle
been
offered
to
them
by
the
working
classes



on
the
contrary

there
is
plainly
going
on
among
the
working
classes



under
the
influence
of
the
deplorable
crises
which
affect
the
industrial


world

an
instinctive
and
ever
increasing
movement
towards
this


association
of
common
and
professional
interests

the
notion
of
which
is


suggested
by
the
natural
sentiment
of
right
and
wrong

as
well
as
by


some
confused
memory

obscured
by
revolutionary
doctrines

of
the


traditions
of
labour
in
france

which
predisposes
the
working
man
to


seek
safety
in
a
return
to
the
old
system
of
the
corporations

a


similar
feeling
exists
among
the
employers

who
desire

though
they
too


often
despair
of
seeing

a
closer
union
of
interests
between
themselves


and
their
working
men

wherever
the
movement
languishes

one
of
the


chief
causes
will
be
found
to
be
the
apathy

the
discouragement

and
the


frivolity
of
the
upper
classes







in
the
case
of
great
factories
like
that
of
the
val
des
bois

the


christian
corporations
naturally
are
sufficient
unto
themselves

there


the
employer
and
the
employed
between
them
constitute
a
small
world



which
can
take
care
of
itself
and
carry
out
the
numerous
subsidiary


features
of
the
system

such
as
the
promotion
of
domestic
economy

the


establishment
of
savings
funds

the
organisation
of
festivals
and
of


courses
of
instruction

without
relying
much

or
at
all

upon
any


co
operation
from
without

it
is
in
the
development
of
the
system
for


the
benefit
of
working
men
who
are
isolated
in
their
work

or
employed


in
small
establishments

that
the
co
operation
of
the
upper
classes
is


needed

and
while
i
incline
to
think
that
there
is
still
much
ground
for


the
strong
language
on
this
point
employed
in
the
report
of


there


appears
to
be
no
doubt
that
a
great
improvement
has
taken
place
during


the
last
three
or
four
years

in

the
efforts
of
the
cardinal


archbishop
of
reims

the
bishop
of
angers

and
of
other
energetic


prelates

secured
the
active
participation
of
the
holy
see
in
the


promotion
of
this
work

in
february
of
that
year
a
pilgrimage
to
rome
of


members
of
the
catholic
clubs
of
france
was
organised

the
pilgrims
were


received
in
special
audience
by
leo
xiii


and
he
gave
his
papal


approbation
and
benediction
to
the
work
in
a
very
remarkable
address


which
produced
a
deep
and
widespread
impression
throughout
catholic


france

similar
pilgrimages
were
made
in

and
in







one
very
important
effect
of
this
has
been
to
bring
about
a
better


understanding
between
the
parochial
clergy
of
france
in
general
and


these
steadily
increasing
lay
organisations

it
is
in
the
nature
of


things
that
the
clergy
should
be
slow
in
giving
their
unreserved
aid
to


any
movement

no
matter
how
admirable
in
itself

which
involves
a
good


deal
of
extra
clerical
activity
in
matters
religious

this
was


illustrated
in
the
attitude
of
the
english
protestant
clergy
towards


wesley
and
whitfield

and
there
are
some
curious
coincidences

of
course


absolutely
undesigned

between
some
of
the
methods
of
the
great
and


powerful
protestant
sect
of
the
wesleyans
and
those
of
m

harmel
s


catholic
clubs






the
methodist

class
leader


for
example

reappears
in
a
modified
form


in
the

zelateurs

and

zelatrices

of
the
harmel
clubs
and


fraternities

these
are
members

working
men
and
working
women

who
are


willing
to
devote
themselves
to
promoting
religious
sentiments
and


practices
among
their
comrades

and
who
hold
regular
meetings
to


consider
and
work
out
the
best
and
most
practical
way
of
doing
this






it
is
not
surprising
that
in
many
cases
the
cures
should
have
looked


with
a
little
uneasiness
upon
the
development
of
such
a
system
until
it


had
been
fully
considered
and
formally
approved
by
the
highest
authority


in
the
church

of
its
efficacy
from
the
point
of
view
of
m

harmel
there


can
be
no
doubt






something
not
wholly
unlike
the

exclusive
dealing

which
contributes
so


much
to
the
strength
of
methodism
in
america
has
also
been
established


for
the
benefit
of
the
members
of
m

harmel
s
christian
corporation



this
is

exclusive
dealing

of
an
honest
and
honourable
sort

and
must


not
be
confounded
with
the
rascally

exclusive
dealing

known
in
ireland


as

boycotting


it
combines
a
system
of

privileged
purveyors

with
an


accumulative
savings
fund






the
firm
of
harmel
brothers

acting
for
the
corporation

makes
contracts


with
tradesmen
at
val
des
bois

grocers

butchers

bakers

and
the


like

by
which
the
tradesmen
bind
themselves
to
sell
certain
wares
to


members
of
the
christian
corporations

and
to

during

ten
years

and
especially
since
the
passage
of

of

the
scope
of
these
christian
corporations

not
only
at


val
des
bois
and
at
reims

but
all
over
france

has
been
considerably


extended

many
of
them
have
now
the
character
of
true
guilds

as
at


poitiers

for
example

where
there
is
a
corporation
of
the
builders


under
the
invocation
of
st

thus

it
will
be
seen

be
turned
quite
as
effectually
to


purposes
of
concord
and
harmony
as
to
purposes
of
discontent
and
strife



the
corporation
of
st

nicholas
may
receive
gifts
and
legacies
in
aid
of


its
corporation
funds
and
purposes

and
generally
take
an
active
part



like
all
these
corporations

as
was
pointed
out
by
leo
xiii

in
his



encyclical
of
april





in
protecting

under
the

guidance
of


the
faith

both
the
interests
and
the
morals
of
the
people







it
already
has
within
its
sphere
of
action
a
confraternity
of
our
lady


of
the
factory

comprising

members

a
mutual
aid
society
with



members

an
assistance
fund
with

members

and
a
domestic
economy


fund

the
principle
of
which
is
that
certain
dealers
make
a
discount
on


their
wares
to
members
of
the
corporation
which
is
certified
to
by
them


in
counters
of
different
values

these
counters
are
receivable
by
the


corporation
in
payment
of
the
assessments
and
subscriptions
of
the


members






the
steady
development
of
these
institutions
during
the
last
four
or


five
years
has
led
to
the
organisation
by
them
of
a
complete
general


system
of
administration

provincial
and
national

the
corporations
are


grouped
not
by
departments
but
by
provinces






provincial
assemblies
are
held

by
which
delegates
are
named
to
attend


an
annual
general
assembly
at
paris

at
the
general
assembly
of




held
on
june



delegates
were
present

and
the
session
of
the


assembly
was
opened
by
the
delegation
from
dauphiny

the
chair
being


taken
by
one
of
its
members

m

roche

in
virtue

as
he
explained
to
the


crowded
audience
in
the
large
hall
of
the
horticultural
society
in
the


rue
de
grenelle

of
his
descent

from
a
representative
of
the
estates
of


dauphiny
in



the
work
of
the
assembly
was
divided
between
four


committees

one
on
moral
and
religious
interests

one
on
public


interests

one
on
commercial
and
industrial
interests

and
one
on


agricultural
and
rural
interests






from
this
it
will
be
seen
that
the
principles
of
the
movement
are
being


systematically
applied
to
the
whole
field
of
active
life
in
france

the


general
maxim
of
the
organisation
is
the
sound

sensible

and
military


maxim

of
st

vincent
de
paul


let
us
keep
our
rules

and
our
rules


will
keep
us


and
i
think
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
french


freemasons

and
the
fanatics
of
unbelief
generally
who
have
launched
the


government
of
the
third
republic
upon
its
present
course

will
find
this


new
christian
organisation
of
capital
and
labour
a
troublesome
factor
in


the
political
field






we
have
seen
what
came
in
germany
of
the

cultur
kampf


and
there
are


curious
analogies
between
the
work
and
the
spirit
of
the
catholic
clubs


in
france
to
day

and
the
ideas
of
monseigneur
von
ketteler

which
gave


vigour
and
vitality
to
the
great

party
of
the
centre


in
the
contest


with
the
chancellor

where
the
giant
of
berlin
had
the
wisdom
to
give


way

the
pigmies
of
paris
are
likely
to
persist
until
they
are
crushed



for
they
have
burned
their
ships

as
the
chancellor
never
burned
his



and
they
are
dogmatists

while
he
is
a
statesman

he
sought
to
control


and
use
the
catholic
church
in
germany

their
object
is

as
one
of
the


ablest
republicans
in
france

jules
simon

long
ago
told
them

to


supplant
a
state
church
of
belief
by
a
state
church
of
unbelief

in


america
and
in
england
when
men
talk
of

religious
freedom


they
mean


the
freedom
of
a
man
to
profess
and
practise
his
own
religion

what
the


third
french
republic
means
by

religious
freedom

is
freedom
from


religion

their
legislation
has
tended

ever
since


not
indirectly


nor
by
implication

but
directly
and
avowedly

to
establish
in
france
a


state
of
things
in
which

not
catholics
only

but
all
men
who
profess


any
form
of
religion

shall
be
treated
as
protestants
were
in
france


after
the
revocation
of
the
edict
of
nantes

or
as
catholics
were
in


ireland
under
william
iii

this
is
the
meaning
of
m

gambetta
s
war
cry



clericalism
is
the
enemy


the
phrase
was
his

but
the
policy
was


announced
by
his
party
long
before
he
invented
the
phrase
in


it


was
distinctly
formulated
in

by
a
republican
leader
much
better


equipped
for
dealing
with
such
questions
than
m

gambetta

who
was
the


boanerges
not
the
paul
of
the
french
gospel
of
unbelief






on
september




m

challemel
lacour

in
a
remarkable
speech

laid


it
down
as
a
fundamental
principle
of
the
republican
policy
that
the


state
should
so
control
all
the
higher
branches
of
education
as
to


secure
what
he
called

the
moral
unity
of
france


it
was
on
this


principle
that
napoleon
in

had
re
organised
the
university
of


france

m

challemel
lacour
unhesitatingly
called
upon
the
republicans


to
adopt
it

if
catholics
or
protestants
or
israelites
were
allowed
to


found
universities
of
their
own
and
confer
degrees
and
diplomas

what


would
become
of
the

moral
unity
of
france


the
duty
of
the
republicans


was
to
protect
and
develop
this

moral
unity


so
long
as
one
frenchman


could
be
found
in
france
who
believed
anything
not
believed
by
every


other
frenchman

so
long
this

moral
unity

would
be
imperfect

the


french
liberals
of

obviously
made
a
great
mistake
when
they
put



freedom
of
education

as
a
right
of
frenchmen
in
the
charter

m



guizot

the
great
protestant
minister
of
louis
philippe

obviously
made


a
great
mistake
when
he
established
the
principles
of
free
primary


education
in


the
republicans
of

obviously
made
a
great


mistake
when
they
proclaimed

freedom
of
education

as
a
republican


principle

the
jacobins
of

were
the
true

children
of
light


and


they
alone
understood
how
really
to
achieve
the

moral
unity
of
france




m

challemel
lacour
did
not
say
this
in
so
many
words

but
he
did
say
in


so
many
words
that
he
objected
to
see
any
bill
passed
which
should


establish

freedom
of
education


and
permit
clerical
persons
to
found


universities

because


instead
of
establishing
the
moral
unity
of


france

this
newfangled
liberty
would
only
aggravate
the
division
of


frenchmen
into
two
sets
of
minds
moving
upon
different
lines
to


different
conclusions

the
young
men
educated
in
these
universities


he


said


will
become
zealous
apostles
of
catholicism

the
more
ardour
they


put
into
their
proselytism
the
more
antagonism
they
will
excite


at


this
passage
in
m

challemel
lacour
s
extraordinary
speech

according
to


the
official
report

a
member
of
the
right
broke
in
with
the
very


natural
exclamation


and
why
not

is
not
that
liberty

liberty
for


all


to
which
m

challemel
lacour
discreetly
made
no
reply

but
went
on


to
say


instead
of
establishing
our
moral
unity

you
will
heap
up


combustibles
in
the
country
until
shocks
are
produced
and
perhaps


cataclysms







this
is
the
doctrine
of
the
worthy
lord
mayor
in

barnaby
rudge

who


querulously
exclaims
to
mr

harwood
when
that
gentleman
came
to
him


asking
for
protection
against
the
gordon
rioters


what
are
you
a


catholic
for

if
you
were
not
a
catholic
the
rioters
would
let
you


alone

i
do
believe
people
turn
catholics
a
purpose
to
vex
and
worrit


me



moral
unity

would
have
saved
the
good
lord
mayor
a
great
deal
of


trouble


moral
unity

would
have
kept
things
quiet
and
comfortable


throughout
the
roman
empire
under
diocletian

and
throughout
the
low


countries
under
phillip
ii

and
alva

and
throughout
england
under
henry


viii

the
jacobins
of

did
their
best
to
organise

moral
unity

in


france
with
the
help
of
the
guillotine

and
of
the
committee
of
public


safety
and
of
the
hired
assassins
who
butchered
prisoners
in
cold
blood






here

at
reims

in
september


while
marat

the
friend
of
the


people

and
danton
the

minister
of
justice

were
employing
maillard
the



hero
of
the
bastile

and
his
salaried
cut
throats
to
promote
public


economy
and
private
liberty
by
emptying
the
prisons
of
paris

certain


agents
of
marat
made
a
notable
effort
in
behalf
of
the

moral
unity
of


france


to
this
effort
the
melodramatic
historians
of
the
french


revolution
have
done
scant
justice

mr

carlyle

for
example

alludes


to
it
only
in
a
casual
half
disdainful
way

which
would
be
almost


comical
were
the
theme
less
ghastly


at
reims


he
observes


about


eight
persons
were
killed

and
two
were
afterwards
hanged
for
doing
it




the
contest
of
this
curious
passage
plainly
shows
that
he
imagined
these



eight
persons


more
or
less

to
have
been

killed

by
the
people
of


reims

roused
into
a
patriotic
frenzy
by
the
circular
which
marat

panis


and
sergent
sent
out
to
the
provinces
calling
upon
all
frenchmen
to


imitate
the

people
of
paris


and
massacre
all
the
enemies
of
the


revolution
at
home
before
marching
against
the
foreign
invaders

that


the

people

of
reims
thus
aroused
should
only
have
killed

about
eight


persons

really
seemed
to
him

one
would
say

hardly
worthy
of
a
truly



titanic

and

transcendental

epoch

there
is
something
essentially


bucolic
in
the
impression
which
mobs
and
multitudes
always
seem
to
make


upon
mr

carlyle
s
imagination

of
what
really
happened
at
reims
in


september

he
plainly
had
no
accurate
notion

he
obviously
cites


from
some
second
hand
contemporary
accounts
of
the
transactions
there


this
statement

that

about
eight
persons
were
killed


because

as
it


happens

we
have
a
full
precise
and
official
report
of
the
killing
of


all
these
persons

with
their
names
and
details
of
the
massacre

drawn


up
on
september




by
the
municipal
authorities
of
reims
and


signed
by
all
the
members
of
the
council
general

had
mr

carlyle
seen


this
report

it
would
have
shown
him
that
marat

panis
and
sergent
knew


what
they
were
about
when
they
sent
out
their
famous
or
infamous


circular

just
as
marat
and
danton
knew
what
they
were
about
when
they


organised
the
massacres
of
september
in
the
prisons
of
paris

the



people

of
reims
had
no
more
to
do
with
the
killing
of

about
eight


persons

in
the
streets
and
squares
of
this
historic
city
in
september



than
the

people

of
paris
had
to
do
with
the
atrocious
butcheries


at
the
abbeys
and
bicetre
and
la
force
and
the
conciergerie

mr

carlyle


ought
to
have
learned
even
from
the

histoire
parlementaire

of
buchez


and
roux

which
he
seems
to
have
freely
consulted

that

the
days
of


september
were
an
administrative
business







what
actually
happened
at
reims
in
september

is
worth
telling

it


does
not
prove

as
mr

carlyle
almost
dolefully
takes
it
to
prove

that


in
the
provinces
the

sansculottes
only
bellowed
and
howled
but
did
not


bite


it
does
prove
that
when
they
bit

they
bit
to
order

and
under


impulses
no
more

titanic

or

transcendental

than
those
which
in
our


own
time
lead
active
politicians
to
invent
lies
about
the
character
of


their
opponents

and
to
manufacture
emotional
issues
on
the
eve
of
a


sharp
political
contest






the
subsidised
parisian
insurrection
of
august




prostrated
the


monarchy

but
it
did
not
found
the
republic

it
was
the
death
knell
both


of
petion
and
of
the
girondists

who
had
been
most
active
in
secretly
or


openly
promoting
it

the
constitution
having
been
torn
into
shreds



power
became
a
prize
to
be
fought
for
by
all
the
demagogues
and
all
the


factions
in
paris

the
legislative
assembly
fell
into
the
trough
of
the


sea

the
sections
of
paris
supported
marat
in
calmly
laying
hands
on
the


printing
presses
and
material
of
the
royal
printing
office

and


converting
his
abominable
newspaper
into
a

journal
of
the
republic


he


was
voted
a
special

tribune
of
honour

in
the
hall
of
the
council

on


august

he
openly
called
upon
the

people

to

march
in
arms
to
the


prison
of
the
abbaye

take
out
the
prisoners
there

especially
the


officers
of
the
swiss
guard
and
their
accomplices

and
put
them
to
the


sword


this
was
an
electoral
proceeding

the
members
of
the
national


convention
were
then
about
to
be
chosen

under
a
law
passed
by
the


expiring
legislature

electors
of
the
members
were
first
to
be
chosen
by


the
voters
on
august


and
the
electors
thus
chosen
were
to
meet
on


september


and
choose
the
members
of
the
convention

it
was
in
view
of


this
second
and
decisive
election
day
that
marat
and
danton
settled
the


date
at
which
the
great
patriotic
work
of

emptying
the
prisons

should


begin

and
it
was
in
view
of
this
day
also
that
the
circular
already


mentioned
of
marat

panis
and
sergent
was
sent
forth
to
all
places
at


which
a
lively
administration
of
murder
and
pillage
would
be
most
likely


to
conduce
to
the
choice
by
the
electors
of
deputies
agreeable
to
the


authors
of
the
circular






the
electors
for
the
department
of
the
marne
chosen
on
august

were
to


meet
in
reims
on
september


and
choose
the
deputies
for
that


department
to
sit
in
the
convention






in
reims
marat
had
a
faithful
personal
ally
in
the
person
of
the


procureur
syndic

the
most
important
national
functionary
in
the
city



this
man

couplet

called
beaucourt

was
a
disreputable
and
apostate


ex
monk
who
had
married
an
ex
nun

his
position

of
course

gave
him
a


great
influence
over
the
least
respectable
part
of
the
population

and


with
marat
and
danton
at
his
back
in
paris
he
cared
nothing
for
the


mayor
and
the
municipal
authorities

from
august

to
august

he
kept


issuing
incendiary
placards
and
making
inflammatory
speeches
in
reims



on
august

he
received
an
intimation
from
paris
that
a
column
of


so
called

volunteers

was
in
motion
for
reims

and
that
he
must
have


things
ready
for
them

to
this
end
he
caused
the
arrest
of
the


postmaster

m

guerin

and
of
a
poor
young
letter
carrier
named
carton



on
a
charge
of
sequestrating
and
burning

compromising
letters

which


ought
to
have
been
turned
over
to
him
and
the

justice
of
the
republic







on
the
morning
of
the
election
day
there
marched
into
reims
the
expected



volunteers


who
carried
banners
proclaiming
them
to
be

men
of
the


th
of
august


couplet
received
them
and
feasted
them

they
broke
up


into
squads
and
went
roaring
about
reims
denouncing

the
aristocrats



and
demanding

justice
upon
all
public
enemies


they
finally
broke
open


the
prison

and
dragging
out
the
unfortunate
postmaster

cut
him
to


pieces
in
front
of
the
hotel
de
ville

some
courageous
citizens


contrived
to
smuggle
out
of
their
reach
the
young
letter
carrier

and


took
him
for
safety
into
the
hall
of
the
municipal
council






there
the
murderers
followed
him

excited
by
a
speech
from
the


procureur
syndic

who
knowing
that
no
trial
had
been
had

did
not


scruple
to
say
that

nothing
could
excuse
the
unfaithful


letter
carrier







the
town
officers
tried
to
get
carton
out
by
a
back
door

but
marat
s


murderers
were
too
quick
for
them

and
the
poor
youth
was
torn
to


pieces

while
this
was
doing
the
procureur
syndic
provided
another


victim

he
arrested
on
some
pretext
a
retired
officer
of
the
army

m

de


montrosier

ex
commandant
of
lille

then
in
the
house
of
his


father
in
law

m

andrieux

one
of
the
first
magistrates
of
reims

m

de


montrosier
being
taken
to
prison

the
maratist
mob
broke
again
into
the


prison

dragged
him
out

killed
him

and
carried
his
head
all
over
reims


on
a
pike

meanwhile
a
detachment
went
out
to
a
neighbouring
village
in


quest
of
two
of
the
canons
of
reims

who
had
taken
refuge
there

brought


them
back
to
the
city

and
shot
them
dead
in
the
street

night
now


coming
on

the
apostles
of
the

moral
unity
of
france


many
of
them
by


this
time
being
exceedingly
drunk

kindled
a
huge
bonfire
in
front
of


the
hotel
de
ville

flung
into
it
the
mutilated
corpses
of
their


victims

and
towards
midnight
laying
hands
upon
two
priests

mm

romain


and
alexandre

threw
them
into
the
flames

another
band
during
the


evening
broke
into
the
venerable
church
of
st

remi

and
tearing
down


the
shields
and
banners
which
for
fourteen
centuries
had
hung
above
the


tomb
of
the
great
archbishop
who
made
france
a
christian
kingdom



brought
these
to
the
bonfire
and
consumed
them






during
this
day
of
horrors

the
electors
of
the
department
had
been
in


session

as
the
news
reached
them
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
streets



one
thought
came
into
the
minds
of
all
the
decent
men
among
them

to
get


through
as
fast
as
possible
and
quit
the
city

at
the
first
ballot



electors
were
present

at
the
seventh
only

remained

of
these




being
the
compact

republican

minority

gave
their
votes
on
that
ballot


to
drouet

the
postmaster
s
son
of
ste
menehould

mr

carlyle
s

bold


old
dragoon


who
stopped
the
carriage
of
louis
xvi

at
varennes

he
was


one
of
the
special
adherents
of
marat

and
a
most
vicious
and
venal


creature

as
his
own
memoirs

giving
among
other
matters
an
account
of


his
grotesque
attempt
to
fly
down
out
of
his
austrian
prison
with
a
pair


of
paper
wings

abundantly
attest

he
escaped
the
guillotine

and


naturally
enough
turned
up
under
the
empire
as
an
obsequious
sub
prefect


at
ste
menehould

the
whole
of
the
elections

which
in
normal


circumstances
would
have
occupied
at
least
three
days

were
hurried


through
before
midnight
of
the
first
day






couplet

called
beaucourt

was
satisfied

but
so
were
not
the

men
of


the
th
of
august


they
got
their
pay
of
course

but
they
wanted
more


blood

at

a
m

the
next
morning
they
seized
the
venerable
cure
of


st

jean

the
abbe
paquot

and
dragged
him
before
couplet

insisting


that
he
should
take
the
constitutional
oath

couplet
tried
to
explain


that
the
time
for
taking
it
had
expired
on
august


but
the
courageous


abbe

looking
his
assassins
in
the
face

said
to
them


i
will
not
take


it

it
is
against
my
conscience

if
i
had
two
souls
i
would
gladly
give


one
of
them
for
you

i
have
but
one

and
it
belongs
to
my
god


he
had


hardly
uttered
the
words
when
he
was
struck
down
and
cut
to
pieces



almost
at
the
same
moment
another
priest
more
than
eighty
years
of
age



the
curate
of
rilly

refusing
to
take
the
oath

was
hanged
upon
the
bar


of
a
street
lantern
before
the
eyes
of
the
mayor
of
reims

who
tried
in


vain
to
disperse
or
control
these

sans
culottes


who

according
to
mr



carlyle


howled
and
bellowed

but
did
not
bite







by
this
time
the
news
came
of
the
surrender
of
verdun
to
the
prussians



and
the
tocsin
began
to
sound
from
the
great
bells
of
the
cathedral

the


citizens
of
reims
suddenly
took
courage
from
the
sense
of
the
national


peril

not
to
fall
upon
and
slay
helpless
and
unarmed
prisoners

but
to


make
head
against
the
murderers
and
scoundrels
who
were
domineering
over


their
city

the
local
national
guards
began
to
appear

and
were
shortly


reinforced
by
a
column
of
volunteers
from
the
country
armed
to
meet
the


invaders

the
mayor
took
command
of
them
and
marched
to
the
hotel
de


ville

there
they
found
that
one
chateau

an
agent
of
couplet

had
been


secretly
denounced
by
his
employer
as
a
spy
and
promptly
hanged
by
the


parisians
on
the
same
lantern
bar
from
which
the
night
before
they
had


hanged
the
aged
cure
of
rilly

his
dead
body
had
been
flung
into
the


still
blazing
bonfire
kept
up
all
night
with
woodwork
from
the
pillaged


churches
of
reims

the
champions
of

moral
unity

had
also
laid
hands
on


the
wife
of
this
wretched
man

and
were
on
the
point
of
throwing
her


alive
into
the
flames
when
the
mayor
and
the
troops
appeared

the
order


to

charge
bayonets

was
given
and
the
whole
brood
of
scoundrels


thereupon
broke
and
fled
in
all
directions






all
these
details

with
others
too
loathsome
to
be
here
reproduced

are



as
i
have
said

taken
from
an
official

proces
verbal

drawn
up
at
reims


on
september




and
signed
by
every
member
of
the
council
general



this
record
was
produced
when
in


after
the
fall
of
robespierre
had


opened
the
way
for
the
great
reaction
which
finally
made
napoleon
master


of
france

the
tribunals
of
the
department
of
the
marne
took
steps
to


bring
to
justice
such
of
the
assassins
of

as
they
could
lay
hands


upon

on
the

thermidor

an
iii


two
wretches

one
a
newspaper
vendor


and
the
other
a
slopshop
keeper

were
condemned
to
death
and
executed


for
the
murder
of
the
abbe
paquot
and
of
the
cure
of
rilly

two
others



a
glazier
and
a
shoemaker

were
condemned
to
six
years
in
the


chain
gang






the
evidence
on
which
these
assassins
were
convicted
in

had
then


been
for
two
years
in
the
hands
of
the
municipal
authorities
at
reims



but
during
these
two
years
france
had
been
the
football
of
the
employers


and
accomplices
of
these
assassins

the
municipal
authorities
had
been


powerless
to
prevent
these
murders

which
were
committed
in
the
public


streets
and
under
the
protection
of
the
procureur
syndic
of
the


department

the
official
representative
at
reims
of
the

minister
of


justice


danton

at
paris

they
were
equally
powerless
to
punish
them






the
mayor
of
reims
was
fortunate
to
escape
denunciation
at
paris
for


his
attempt
to
save
the
lives
of
some
of
the
victims

that
was
an


offence
against
the

moral
unity

which
the
first
republic
tried
to


establish






there
was
a
heroic
mayor
in
those
days
at
lille
named
andre

when
the


duke
of
saxe
teschen
with
his
wife

a
sister
of
marie
antoinette



appeared
before
lille
at
the
head
of
an
austrian
army
and
demanded
the


surrender
of
the
place

mayor
andre

who
was
a
republican
but
not
of
the



moral
unity

type

replied
that
he
had
sworn
to
keep
the
place

and
he


would
keep
his
oath

with
the
help
of
the
ancient
artillery
corporations


of
the
old
flemish
city

corporations
of
which
the

honourable
artillery


corps

of
london
and
of
boston
are
offshoots


mayor
andre
did
keep
his


oath
and
kept
lille

the
minister
roland

the
respectable
confederate
of


the
virtuous
petion

sent
him
promises
of
help

but
no
help

why



because
mayor
andre
had
taken
the
lead
in
a
masculine
protest
of
the


honest
people
of
lille
against
that
ruffianly
invasion
of
the
tuileries


by
the
mob
on
june

which
the
virtuous
petion

mayor
of
paris

and
his


respectable
confederate
roland
had
for
their
own
purposes
promoted

so


mayor
andre
got
words
and
no
troops

but
lille
took
care
of
herself



bore
a
tremendous
bombardment
for
days
without
flinching

and
finally



in
the
early
days
of
october

saw
the
saxon
duke
and
his
army
march


away

valmy
having
opened
the
eyes
of
brunswick
to
the
utter
futility


and
fanfaronnade
of
the
french
emigrant
noblesse
and
princes

who
had


drawn
up
for
him
and
persuaded
him
against
his
own
better
judgment
to


sign
the
too
famous
and
fatal
proclamation
with
which
he
heralded
the


austro
prussian
advance
into
france

mayor
andre
having
thus
saved
the


grand
north
eastern
bulwark
of
france

his
services
had
to
be
in
some


way
recognised

but
in
what
way

paris
voted
that
lille
had
deserved


well
of
the
nation

which
was
obvious
enough

also
that
lille
should
get


a
million
of
francs
towards
repairing
damages

which
million
of
francs



i
am
assured

never
reached
lille

also
that
a
grand
monument
should


commemorate
the
valour
and
constancy
of
lille

but
the
grand
monument


was
never
erected
until
half
a
century
afterwards

when
king
louis


philippe
took
the
matter
up

and
carried
it
through






with
the
proclamation
of
the
republic
in
september

it
ceased
to
be


meritorious
in
mayors
and
other
municipal
personages
to
protect
life
and


property

repulse
foreign
invaders
and
punish
domestic
criminals



varlet

the
self
appointed

apostle
of
liberty


the
man
with
the


camp
chair
and
the
red
cap

whom
carnot

the
grandfather
of
the
present


president

actually
insisted
that
the
assembly
should
welcome
to
its


floor

gave
the
keynote
of
the
new
order
of
things


we
must
draw
a


veil


he
exclaimed


over
the
declaration
of
the
rights
of
man


and
a


veil
was
indeed
drawn
over
the
declaration
of
the
rights
of
man

here
at


reims

as
elsewhere

proscriptions
and
confiscations
were
the
order
of


the
day

the
glorious
cathedral
of
reims
itself

the
westminster
and


canterbury
in
one
of
france

was
in
continual
peril

nothing
really


saved
it
and
the
archi
episcopal
palace
but
the
religious
and
patriotic


reverence
of
the
people
of
reims
for
the
memory
of
jeanne
d
arc

in
that


archi
episcopal
palace
the
peasant
girl
of
domremy

the
virgin
saviour


of
france

had
been
lodged

in
that
cathedral
she
had
stood

her
banner


in
her
hand

and
watched
the
solemn
consecration
of
her
mission
and
her


triumph

the
emissaries
of
plunder
and
murder
from
paris
shrank
from


driving
the
remois
to
extremities
on
that
issue

but
they
desecrated
the


building
and
defaced
it
as
much
as
they
dared






i
am
told
that
robespierre
during
his
dictatorship
interfered
to
put
a


stop
to
the
vandalism
of
his
disciples
here

and
that
we
owe
to
him
the


preservation
of
the
magnificent
groups
which
still
exist
of
statues


representing
scenes
in
the
life
of
the
virgin
mary

the
groups
above
the


head
of
the
virgin
on
the
double
lintel
had
already
been
dashed
to


pieces
when
he
was
appealed
to

the
groups
below

still
unharmed

afford


unanswerable
proof
that
the
sculptors
of
this
part
of
europe
in
the


thirteenth
century
must
have
been
familiar
with
the
best
traditions
of


their
art

if
robespierre
preserved
these

we
may
forgive
him
not
only


for
sending
his
dear
camille
desmoulins
and
his
detested
danton
to
the


guillotine

but
even
for
replacing
the
shattered
groups
of
the
nativity



the
presentation

and
the
death
of
the
virgin
with
this
inscription
of


his
own
devising


the
french
people
believe
in
the
existence
of
god
and


in
the
immortality
of
the
soul


under
the
first
consul
this
inscription


gave
place
to
the
latin
dedication
now
visible






pillaging
he
did
not
prevent

perhaps
could
not

one
wizened
old


reprobate

ruhl

got
himself
great
republican

kudos

by
persistently


putting
about
a
legend
that
he
had
successfully
stolen
the
sacred


ampulla

from
which
st

remi
had
anointed
clovis
king
of
france

and
had


dashed
it
to
pieces
in
public

that
he
did
indeed
dash
in
pieces


publicly
a
flask
of
glass
is

i
am
assured

indubitable

but
not
less


indubitable
is
it
that
he
did
not
dash
in
pieces
the
sacred
ampulla



ruhl
was
a
bit
of
a
scholar

and
his
legend
was
obviously
suggested
to


him
by
the
traditional
story
of
the
frankish
warrior
who
smashed
a


sacred
vase
at
soissons

and
whose
own
head
the
stalwart
king
clovis


afterwards
clove
in
twain
with
his
battle
axe
on
the
champ
de
mars
in


requital
of
the
deed

curiously
enough

it
was
written
that
the
head
of


ruhl
should
likewise
in
the
end
be
smashed

as
it
was
by
himself
with
a


pistol
at
paris

may




to
save
it
from
the
guillotine






all
the
churches
of
reims
did
not
escape
so
well
as
the
cathedral



st

nicaise


the
jewel
of
reims

and
the
masterpiece
of
a
famous


architect
of
the
thirteenth
century

hues

whose
name
is


preserved
in
that
of

of

pillaged
and


then
pulled
down

the
materials
and
the
site
being
sold
at
a

mock


auction

to
santerre

the
enterprising
brewer

who

pulled
the
wires

of


all
the
patriotic
emotions
of
the
faubourg
st

antoine
from
the
outset


of
the
revolution

got
himself
thereby
made
a
general

and
in
that


capacity
conducted
louis
xvi

to
the
scaffold

where

as
all
the
world


knows

he
ordered
the
drums
to
drown
the
last
words
of
the
king

he
was


an
incorrigible
and
indefatigable
speculator

and
while
he
drove
a


roaring
trade
at
paris
in
beer

he
was
always
on
the
look
out
for


demolished
churches
and
convents
in
the
provinces

napoleon
took
his


measure
promptly

subsidised
and
used
him
to
good
purpose

hearing
once


that
there
was
a
ferment
brewing
in
st

antoine

the
emperor
sent
an


officer
to
santerre


go
and
tell
that
fellow


he
said


that
if
i
hear


one
word
from
the
faubourg
st

antoine
i
will
have
him
instantly
shot







the

titanic

and

transcendental

faubourg
remained
as
mute
as
a
mouse






in
no
french
city
are
the
memories
of
the
revolutionary
orgie
more


offensively
out
of
key
with
the
actual
aspect
and
the
great
associations


of
the
place
than
in
reims

whatever
may
have
been
the
ways
of
the


working
people
here
forty
years
ago

i
have
always
been
struck
by
their


quiet
and
orderly
demeanour

as
well
as
by
the
general
air
of
prosperity


and
animation
which
pervades
the
city

its
grand
cathedral

the
most


consummate
type
which
exists
of
the
great
ogival
architecture
of
the


thirteenth
century

stands

the
archaeologists
tell
us

on
the
spot
where


the
romans
planted
their
citadel
sixteen
centuries
ago

like
a
citadel



it
dominates
the
whole
city
to
day

a
fortress
no
longer

like
the
roman


citadel

of
armed
force

but
of
faith

charity

and
hope

seven


centuries
have
not
shaken
the
solidity
of
its
massive
fabric

they
who


built
it

dreamt
not
of
a
perishable
home


but
only
a
year
ago
a


serious
dislocation
appeared
in
the
framework
of
the
stupendous


rose
window
over
the
grand
entrance

and
this

with
other
unsatisfactory


symptoms
observable
here
and
there
in
the
building

lend
colour
to
the


theory
that
the
great
chalk
bed
upon
which
the
cathedral
stands
may
have


been
affected
by
the
percolation
of
water
from
some
deep
trenches
which



it
seems

were
dug
near
the
northern
and
southern
towers
at
the
entrance


of
the
cathedral

during
the
year


and
unfortunately
left
open


during
the
very
inclement
winter
which
followed






this
is
a
rather
alarming
theory

particularly
if
it
be
true

as
it
is


said
to
be

that
since

the
towers
have
perceptibly
come
out
of


plumb






fortunately
the
see
of
reims
is
now
in
the
charge
of
a
prelate
who
fully


appreciates
the
value
to
art
and
to
civilisation

as
well
as
to
france


and
to
the
church

of
this
magnificent
edifice

when
he
came
here
from


the
bishopric
of
tarbes

his
first
episcopate

in
november


one
of


the
earliest
steps
taken
by
the
present
cardinal
langenieux
was
to
get
a


full
report
on
the
condition
of
the
cathedral
from
m

millet

the


accomplished
successor
of
m

viollet
le
duc
in
the
great
work
of
the


conservation
and
restoration
of
the
historical
monuments
of
france

m



millet

on
august




reported
that
the
flying
buttresses
needed


immediate
attention

and
that

the
gables
and
vaults
of
the
western


facade
were
seriously
damaged

so
that
the
rain
water
was
penetrating


the
masonry
and
threatening
the
destruction
of
the
numerous
statues
and


sculptured
ornaments
of
the
grand
western
portal


this
portal

as
every


traveller
knows

is
simply
matchless
in
the
world

the
archhishop


thereupon
invited
four
of
his
personal
friends

all
at
that
time
members


of
the
ministry

mm

dufaure

leon
say

wallon

and
caillaux

to
reims



to
see
for
themselves
the
state
of
the
cathedral

they
came
and


inspected
the
building

and
after
their
return
to
paris
prepared
a
bill



which
became
a
law
in
december


appropriating
a
sum
of





francs
in
ten
yearly
instalments
to
the
restoration
of
the
cathedral



the
work
began
at
once
under
the
direction
of
m

millet

who


unfortunately
died
in







it
was
prosecuted
after
his
death
by
another
able
architect

m

brugere



and
is
now
in
the
hands
of
m

darcy

who
has
shown
by
his
work
at
evreux


and
st

denis
that
he
is
no
unworthy
successor
of
viollet
le
duc

the


appropriation
made
in

has
been
expended

but
i
am
glad
to
find

on


looking
into
the
budget
for

of
the
ministry
of
public
worship

that


a
sum
of


fr


c

is
still
available
for
the
works
at
reims



this
budget

by
the
way

is
an
instructive
document

it
shows
that
the


whole
outlay
of
the
state
in
france
upon
all
objects
connected
with


public
worship
and
religion
in
france
and
algiers

excepting
the
service


of
the
chaplains
in
the
army
and
the
navy

amounted
in

to
a
little


more
than
one
franc
per
head
of
the
population

the
whole
expense
in


connection
with
the
catholic
church

the
calvinist
and
lutheran


confessions

the
israelitish
religion
and
the
mussulmans

was
no
more


than



francs

a
sum
less
than
the
amount
annually
expended
by


the
protestant
episcopal
church
of
the
single
state
of
new
york
upon


keeping
up
its
churches

colleges

and
clergy

what
proportion
this
sum


bears
to
the
present
annual
income
of
the
church
property
confiscated


under
the
first
republic
it
would
be
interesting
to
ascertain

a


protestant
friend
of
mine
in
the
south
of
france

who
has
made
some


investigations
into
this
subject

tells
me
that
it
cannot
possibly


represent
above

ten
per
cent


of
the
present
actual
product
of
the


former
property
of
the
church

of
the
whole
sum



francs
were


spent
on
the
civil
servants
of
the
ministry

there
are
seven
sub
chiefs


of
bureaux
in
this
ministry

all
of
them
now
doubtless
good
atheists



who
receive
salaries
of
from


to


francs
a
year

the
highest


salary
paid
to
a
protestant
pastor
even
in
paris
is


francs

or



l


a
year

the
cure
of
notre
dame
de
paris
receives


francs



or
less
than

l


a
year

there
are

cures
of
the
first
class
who


receive
from


to


francs
a
year


cures
of
the
second
class


receiving


francs
a
year

and


cures
of
the
third
class


receiving
from


to


francs
a
year

the
thirty
one
clerks
in


the
ministry
receive
from


to


francs
a
year

the


vicar
general
of
paris
receives
no
more
than


francs
a
year

the


archbishop
of
paris
receives

like
all
the
other
archbishops





francs

or

l



a
year

which
is
the
salary
paid
to
the
director
of


the
ministry

the
grand
rabbi
of
the
central
consistory
receives




and
the
grand
rabbi
of
paris


francs
a
year

and
the
salaries
paid


to
the
israelitish
ministers
of
religion
range
from


down
to



francs

the
latter
amount
being
less
by

francs
than
the
wages
of
the


servants
in
the
ministry

the
muftis
and
imams
in
office
receive
from



to


francs
a
year

all
these
salaries

with
the
outlay
on
the


construction

rent

or
maintenance
of
buildings
of
all
kinds
used
for


religious
purposes

pensions

and
travelling
expenses

are
comprised
in


the
total
appropriation
of



francs

or
a
little
more
than





l


for
the
year


during
the
same
year



francs


were
appropriated
for
the
fine
arts
service

i
do
not
say
that
the
sum


thus
devoted
to
the
fine
arts
out
of
the
pockets
of
the
taxpayers
of


france
was
at
all
too
large

but
i
do
say
that
it
is
out
of
all


proportion
large
as
compared
with
the
sum
voted
out
of
the
pockets
of


the
taxpayers
to
the
maintenance
of
religious
institutions

which
an


overwhelming
majority
of
the
people
of
france
regard

and
rightly


regard

as
essential
to
the
stability
of
law
and
order

furthermore



this
budget
of

shows
the
spirit
in
which
the
fanatics
of

moral


unity

are
prosecuting
their
war
against
all
religions
in
france

in



the
government
s
budget
amounted
to



francs

here
we
have


a
reduction
within
six
years
of
more
than



francs

in

m



jules
roche

now
a
deputy
for
the
first
district
of
chambery
and
an
ally


of
m

clemenceau

proposed
to
reduce
the
budget
of
public
worship
to





francs

the
third
republic

it
will
be
seen

is
getting
on


towards
the
proposition
of
m

jules
roche

a
proposition
which
clearly


combines
everything
that
is
most
open
to
objection
in
a
legal
connection


between
the
state
and
religion
with
everything
that
is
most
odious
and


dangerous
in
an
open
war
of
the
state
against
religion






during
these
six
years
the
leaders
of
this
war
against
religion
have


never
dared
to
draw
up
a
statistical
account
of
the
strength
of
the


various
religious
bodies
in
france

in

one
of
their
followers

m



alfred
talandier

on
february


rashly
proposed
that
a
table
should
be


officially
prepared
of
the
state
of
religious
opinions
in
france

but


the
managers
of
the
cause
of

moral
unity

were
too
wily
to
walk
into


that
trap

they
quietly
stifled
the
proposition

it
really
might
be
a


little
awkward

even
for
a
parliamentary
oligarchy
with
a


strongly
bitted
executive
well
in
hand

to
confront

let
us
say






of
catholics

protestants

israelites

not
to
mention
the


mussulmans
in
africa

with
a
proposition
to
abolish
a
budget
of
worship


amounting
to
a
little
over
a
franc
a
head

for
the
purpose
of
reducing


france
to
a
complete

moral
unity

of
absolute
unbelief
in
god
and
in


the
immortality
of
the
human
soul






cardinal
langenieux
took
possession

as
i
have
said

of
the


archi
episcopal
see
of
reims
in
november


seldom
has
the
right
man


been
put
into
the
right
place
more
exactly
at
the
right
moment

it
was


in
september

that
m

challemel
lacour
unfolded
the
republican


programme
of
war
to
the
knife
against
all
religion

in
september




too

as
i
have
mentioned

the
burning
of
the
factory
at
val
des
bois


called
out
a
general
demonstration
of
sympathy
from
the
catholic


working
men
s
clubs
all
over
france

which
attracted
public
attention
to


the
movement

and
in
october

pius
ix

issued
a
brief
recognising


its
importance
and
earnestly
commending
it






the
new
archbishop
of
reims
was
exceptionally
fitted
by
his
training
and


his
experience
to
promote
such
a
movement






he
was
a
benedictine
of
the
school
of
cluny

bred
in
the
traditions
of


that
illustrious
order

to
which

without
exaggeration

it
may
be
said


that
we
owe
almost
everything
that
is
best
worth
having
in
our
western


civilisation

for
upon
what
does
human
society
rest
in
the
last
resort


if
not
upon
the
two
great
pillars
of
the
rule
of
st

benedict

obedience


and
labour

as
a
priest

the
new
archbishop
had
successively
and


successfully
administered
two
of
the
most
important
parishes
in
paris



one
in
the
workmen
s
quarter
of
the
faubourg
st

antoine

the
other
in


the
quarter
of
the
noblesse

in
the
faubourg
st

germain






after
a
single
year
passed
in
the
episcopate
at
tarbes

that
pleasant


city
on
the
adour
which
all
the
winds
of
the
pyrenees
have
not
yet
quite


disinfected
of
the
memory
of
barere

he
was
translated
to
this
great


historic
see
in
the
prime
of
his
vigour

for
fifteen
years
he
has
so


ruled
it
that
the
christians
of
reims
and
of
the
marne
now
seize
with


delight
upon
every
opportunity
of
manifesting
their
incorrigible


indifference
to
the

moral
unity
of
france


you
meet
workmen
in
the


streets
going
about
their
work
with
religious
medals
openly
displayed



the
churches
of
reims
are
filled
with
men
on
great
church
festivals



taking
all
the
districts
of
the
marne
together

the
revisionists
and


monarchists
at
the
elections
of

outnumbered
considerably
the


government
republicans

these
latter
polled


votes
in
the
marne



against


polled
by
the
former

the
radicals

who
are
very
strong


in
the
first
district
of
reims

polled


votes
there
against
a


revisionist
vote
of



do
not
these
figures
show

what
i
believe
to


be
the
truth

that
the

true
republican

policy
of
reducing
france
to



moral
unity

by
trampling
on
the
traditions
and
coercing
the


consciences
of
the
french
people
is
steadily
dividing
the
french
people


into
two
great
camps

the
camp
of
the
social
and
radical
revolution
and


the
camp
of
the
monarchy

that
there
was
no
necessity
for
this
is


illustrated
by
what
i
have
said
as
to
the
relations
between
the
cardinal


archbishop
of
reims
and
the
republican
ministers
of

who
came
here


on
his
invitation

and
then
took
steps
to
secure
the
preservation
and


restoration
of
the
cathedral

one
of
these
republican
ministers

m



leon
say

who
is
largely
responsible
for
clothing
the
present
government


with
the
power
which
it
abuses

has
just
been
signally
humiliated
by
the


present
government
and
the
dominant
majority






in
the
second
district
of
bergerac
in
the
dordogne

the
monarchist


candidate
for
the
chamber

m

thirion
montauban

received


votes



against


given
to
his
republican
competitor

i
took
a
special


interest
in
this
election

because
m

thirion
montauban
is
the
present


proprietor
of
the
house
of
michel
de
montaigne

which
came
into
his


possession
through
his
marriage
with
the
daughter
of
m

magne

the


eminent
finance
minister
of
napoleon
iii

i
made
a
visit
there
late
in


the
summer

and
found
him
busy
with
his
canvass

on
lines
of
respect
for


personal
liberty
and
the
right
of
men
to
think
their
own
thoughts
as
to


life
and
death

which
would
have
commanded
the
cordial
sympathy
of
the


great
gascon
sceptic

the
tower

the
study

the
bedroom
of
montaigne
are


preserved
by
him
with
religious
care

the
inscriptions
on
the
walls


which
john
sterling
copied
so
lovingly
half
a
century
ago
are
there


still

and
if
indeed
there
be
a
life
of
faith
as
tennyson
says


in


honest
doubt


the
pyrrhonist
seigneur
who
thought
before
pascal
that


the
true
philosophy
was
to
laugh
at
philosophy

would
not
find
himself
a


stranger
in
his
old
haunt
to
day
because
its
lower
hall
has
been


consecrated
as
a
chapel






the
opponents
of
m

thirion
montauban
behaved
throughout
the
contest


with
extraordinary
violence

and
on
one
occasion
put
him
into
serious


personal
peril

however

he
was
elected

when
the
chamber
met
in


november
his
election
was
contested

m

leon
say
took
an
active
part
in


maintaining
the
validity
of
the
returns
which
gave
the
seat
to
m



thirion
montauban

and
the
evidence
in
the
case
was
overwhelmingly
in


his
favour

nevertheless
after
the
report
of
the
committee
was
made

the


majority
of
the
chamber
coolly
invalidated
the
choice
of
the
electors



and
seated
the
candidate
who
had
not
been
elected

it
was
an
open
secret


that
this
was
done
quite
as
much
to
punish
m

leon
say
as
to
exclude
m



thirion
montauban






intolerant
as
the

true
republicans

are
towards
their
political


opponents

they
are
still
more
intolerant
towards
those

false


republicans

who
hesitate
at
framing
the
policy
of
a
french
republic
in


the
nineteenth
century
upon
the
principles
which
led
to
the
revocation


of
the
edict
of
nantes

were
socrates
alive
and
a
frenchman

he
would


stand
no
chance
for
a
government
chair
of
philosophy
in
a
competition


with
the
little
atheist
aristodemus

and
were
david
hume
to
reappear
at


reims

where
he
got
his
early
schooling

he
would
certainly
find
himself


treated
by
the
authorities
as
no
better
than
a
catholic






the
irreligion
of
the
third
republic
is
a
dogmatic
irreligion

bayle


would
find
no
favour
in
its
eyes

because
protesting

as
he
said
he
did



from
his
inmost
soul
protest

against
everything
that
was
ever
said
or


done


he
must
of
course
protest
against
the
nihilism
of
m

marcou
and


m

paul
bert






unfortunately
for
the

true
republicans


it
is
essential
to
their


success
that
with
the
religious
faith
they
should
also
abolish
the


patriotic
traditions
of
france

m

jules
simon

a
republican
and
a


republican
minister
of
public
instruction

has
found
himself
compelled


to
denounce
in
the
clearest
and
strongest
language
the
deliberate


attempt
which
these

true
republicans

are
making

to
teach
the
children


of
france
that
the
glory
of
france
began
with


and
that
it
was


never
so
great
as
under
the
convention







stuff
like
this
is
actually
taught
in
the
schools
into
which
it
is
the


object
of
the
present
french
government
to
drive
by
statute
all
the


children
of
the
country







these
men


says
m

jules
simon


who
proscribe
the
name
of
jesus


christ
and
forbid
it
to
be
mentioned
in
the
schools
of
france

on
the


pretext
that
public
education
must
be
neutral
in
such
matters

do
not


hesitate
to
have
children
compelled
to
attend
schools
in
which
they
are


taught
that
louis
xiv

was
a
tyrant
without
greatness
or
ability

and


that
louis
xvi

was
an
enemy
of
his
country
justly
condemned
and


executed







of
the
great
historic
france

the
france
which
aided
the
american


colonies
to
establish
their
independence

after
contesting
with
england


the
dominion
of
north
america
and
of
india
for
more
than
a
century

the


france
of
montesquieu
and
of
rabelais

of
henri
iv

and
sully

of


francois
i

and
st

louis

of
chivalry
and
of
the
crusades

the
coming


generation
of
frenchmen

if
these
fanatics
can
get
their
way

will
know


no
more
than
their
annamite
fellow
citizens
in
asia

it
is
not


surprising
that
a
government
controlled
by
such
men
with
such
objects


should
have
amnestied
the
criminals
of
the
commune

the

petroleurs

who


destroyed
the
tuileries
and
the
hotel
de
ville
were
only
trying
in
their


practical
way
to
abolish
the
history
of
france
before







here
at
reims
the
history
of
france

i
think

will
die
very
hard

no
one


could
doubt
this
who
visited
the
department
of
the
marne
in
the
month
of


july







when
the

moral
unity

men
began
their
sinister
work
in


the


cardinal
archbishop
of
reims
was
earnestly
urging
upon
the
holy
see
the


beatification
of
the
great
french
pontiff

urban
ii


the
disciple



friend
and
successor
of
hildebrand

and
the
canonisation
of
jeanne


d
arc


that
whitest
lily
in
the
shield
of
france

with
heart
of
virgin


gold







on
july




leo
xiii

confirmed
the
beatification
of
urban
ii

and


fixed
of
course
the
date
of
his
death

july


as
his
place
in
the


calendar
of
church
festivals

in
july

a
solemn
triduum
appointed
by


a
papal
rescript
was
celebrated
with
extraordinary
pomp
in
the
cathedral


of
reims






two
cardinals

one
the
special
legate
of
the
pope

more
than
twenty


bishops

several
abbots
of
the
great
benedictine
order
of
which
urban


ii

was
a
member

and
hundreds
of
the
clergy
from
all
parts
of
france



were
present

the
cardinal
legate
was
attended
by
monsignor
cataldi

so


long
and
so
well
known
to
all
foreigners
in
rome
as
the
master
of
the


ceremonies
to
the
pope

the
cathedral
was
crowded


what
i
should
like


to
know


said
a
quiet
shrewd
master
workman
who
described
to
me
the


effect
produced
by
the
scene
in
the
cathedral


what
i
should
like
to


know
is
why
the
catholics
of
reims
have
not
the
right
upon
such


occasions
to
escort
the
legate
of
the
head
of
the
church
from
the


railway
station
to
the
cathedral
with
a
procession
and
with
music
and


with
banners

is
that
liberty
i
ask
you







the
question
seems
to
me
natural
enough

particularly
as
i
see
that
only


the
other
day
the
freemasons
at
grenoble
were
permitted
to
force


themselves

marching
in
a
body
with
all
their
regalia
and
their
emblems



into
the
funeral
procession
of
a
prefect
who
was
not
a
member
of
their


order
at
all

and
against
the
protest
of
the
bishop
of
grenoble

who
had


been
asked
by
the
family
of
the
dead
man
to
give
him
the
burial
rites
of


the
church

that
the
freemasons
like
other
citizens
should
attend
the


funeral
as
individuals
the
bishop
was
ready
to
admit

but
he
not


unnaturally
declined
to
acquiesce
in
the
deliberate
parade
on
such
an


occasion
of
a
body
openly
and
undisguisedly
hostile
to
christianity
in


all
its
forms






without
a
procession

however

the
triduum
of
the
great
pope
of
the


crusades
was
a
great
success
in


it
led
to
the
organisation
of
a


movement
for
erecting
a
magnificent
monument
to
the
memory
of
urban
ii



at
his
native
place

chatillon
sur
marne

one
of
the
loveliest
little


towns
in
the
valley
of
the
marne

situated
about
twenty
miles
from


reims

early
in

this
monument
was
completed

and
on
july

in
that


year
it
was
unveiled
with
a
solemn
ceremonial
in
the
presence
of
the


cardinal
archbishop
of
reims

of
the
papal
nuncio
at
paris

and
of
many


french
bishops

among
them
the
great
orator
of
the
chamber
of
deputies



monseigneur
freppel

bishop
of
angers

he
delivered
a
most
impressive


discourse
on
the
significance
of
the
crusades

every
sentence
of
which


was
weighted
with
pregnant
allusions
to
the
actual
condition
of


religious
liberty
in
france

these
allusions
were
curiously
emphasised


by
the
absence
of
the
bishop
of
orleans

detained
at
his
post
in
the


city
of

jeanne
d
arc

by
the
sudden

laicisation

of
the
schools
in
his


diocese






the
day
was
what
a
perfect
day
in
the
summer
of
northern
france
can
be



the
scene
might
have
been
planned
by
a
poet
or
a
painter

there
are


other
chatillons
in
france
more
famous
in
history

and
held
in
higher


honour
therefore
by
those
useful
men
the
makers
of
guide
books

than


chatillon
sur
marne

and
it
is
in
the
nature
of
all
castles
to
stand
on


picturesque
sites

as
of
great
rivers
to
flow
by
large
towns

but


neither
the
chatillon
which
saw
the
birth
of
the
admiral
de
coligny

nor


the
chatillon
which
saw
napoleon
throw
away
his
sceptre
with
his


scabbard

stands
more
beautifully
than
the
quiet
little
town
which


nestles
on
its
green
plateau
beneath
the
still
majestic
ruins
of
the


chateau
in
which
the
great
pope
of
the
crusades
was
born

it
overlooks



in
the
verdant
valley
of
the
marne

the
ancient
priory
of
binson



superbly
renovated
now

and
restored
in
great
measure
through
the
zeal


and
energy
of
the
benedictine
archbishop
of
reims

around
it
sweeps
a


great
circle
of
green
and
wooded
hills

dotted
over
with
fair
mansions


and
lordly
parks

for
this
province
of
champagne
is
a
land
of
wealth
as


well
as
of
labour






from
a
shattered
tower
of
the
old
feudal
fortress
floated
side
by
side


the
flags
of
france
and
of
the
holy
see

beside
the
ruins
rose

sharply


defined
and
well
detached
against
the
summer
sky

the
colossal
statue
of


urban
ii

upon
its
lofty
pedestal
of
granite

about
it
were
arrayed
in
a


pomp
of
colour
and
of
flowing
vestments

the
host
of
ecclesiastics
drawn


together
to
do
homage
and
honour
in
the
sight
of
all
men
to
the


illustrious
french
pontiff

whom
the
church
found
not
unworthy
in
days


of
great
stress
and
sore
trial
to
take
up
and
carry
forward
the
work
of


his
friend
and
teacher
and
predecessor

hildebrand

one
need
not
be
a


catholic
to
recognise
the
debt
of
mankind
to
gregory
vii


of
whom



dying
in
exile
and
in
seeming
defeat
at
salerno

sir
james
stephen
has


truly
said
that
he
has

left
the
impress
of
his
gigantic
character
upon


all
succeeding
ages


one
need
only
be
a
moderately
civilised
man
of


common
sense
to
recognise
the
debt
of
mankind
to
odo
de
chatillon

known


in
the
pontificate
as
urban
ii

wherever
in
the
world
the
evensong
of


the
angelus
breathes
peace
on
earth
to
men
of
good
will

it
speaks
of


the
great
pontiff
and
of
the
truce
of
god
which
he
founded

that
the


races
of
christian
europe

suspending
their
internecine
strife

might


unite
to
roll
back
into
asia
once
for
all
the
threatening
invasion
of


islam






but
the
thousands
upon
thousands
of
people
of
both
sexes
and
of
all


conditions
in
life
who
filled
the
vast
plateau
of
chatillon
on
that


summer
day
in
july


and
hailed
with
tumultuous
shouts
the
monument


of
this
great
frenchman
and
great
pope

visibly
took
a
more
than


historic
interest
in
the
occasion

they
were
moved
not
only
by
those



mystic
chords
of
memory

of
which
president
lincoln
knew
the
social
and


political
value
much
better
than
the
french
fanatics
of

moral
unity




but
by
a
vivid
consciousness
of
the
present
peril
of
their
country



their
homes
and
their
faith

once
more

as
in
the
eleventh
century
and


in
the
eighteenth

france
needs
to
day

an
invincible
champion
of
the


freedom
of
the
church

a
defender
of
public
peace

a
reformer
of
morals



a
scourge
of
corruption







this
was
the
true
significance
of
this
memorable
scene
in
the
marne

it


was
in
the
minds
of
that
whole
multitude

and
it
stirred
them
all
with
a


common
impulse
when
the
eloquent
bishop
of
angers

after
sketching
in
a


bold
and
striking
outline
the
career
of
urban
ii


thus
drove
its
lesson


home



urban
ii

and
the
popes
of
the
middle
ages
have
made
for


evermore
impossible
any
return
to
the
pagan
theory
of
the
omnipotence
of


the
state

ah

no
doubt

despite
that
signal
defeat

despotism
will


return
to
the
charge

more
than
once
in
the
course
of
the
ages
we
shall


see
fresh
appeals
to
violence
against
a
power
which
can
defend
itself


only
by
appealing
to
moral
authority

we
shall
see

as
we
saw
under


henry
of
germany

emperors

kings

and
republics
strive
to
forge
chains


for
the
church
by
their
laws
and
their
decrees

but
the
memory
of
the


heroic
struggles
of
the
eleventh
century
will
not
pass
out
of
the
minds


of
the
people

canossa
will
remain
for
ever
an
inevitable
stage
in
the


progress
of
every
power
which
undertakes
to
suppress
religion
and
the


church







this
festival
of
urban
ii

fell
in
the
week
which
includes
the


anniversary
of
the
coronation
of
charles
vii

at
reims
in
the
presence


of
jeanne
d
arc

and
the
cardinal
archbishop
availed
himself
in
july



of
this
circumstance
to
crown
the
manifestation
at
chatillon
by
a


solemn
commemoration
in
the
cathedral
at
reims
of
the
triumph
of
the


peasant
girl
of
domremy

he
was
a
schoolfellow
at
st

sulpice
and
has


been
a
lifelong
friend
of
gounod

and
upon
his
suggestion
the
great


french
composer
produced
for
the
commemoration
his
mass
of
jeanne
d
arc



he
came
from
paris
himself
to
superintend
the
execution
of
the
music



simple

grand

choral

in
the
manner
of
palestrina

music
of
the


cathedral

not
of
the
concert

i
must
leave
my
readers
to
imagine
what


its
effect
was
beneath
those
vast
and
magnificent
arches
which
had


looked
down
four
centuries
ago
upon
the
maid
of
orleans
kneeling
with


her
banner
in
her
hand
before
the
newly
anointed
king
who
owed
his
crown


to
heaven
and
to
her

and
praying
that

now
her
mission
was
fulfilled




the
gentle
prince
would
let
her
go
back
to
her
own
people
and
to
tend


her
sheep







i
do
not
think
it
would
be
easy
to
convince
anyone
who
that
day


witnessed
the
profound
and
silent
emotion
of
those
assembled
thousands


in
the
cathedral
of
reims
that
the
religious
sentiment
is
either
dead
or


dying
in
france

in
the
evening
of
the
same
day
the
cathedral
was


thronged
again

and
thousands
of
men
stood
there
for
an
hour

as
i
saw


men
stand
in
rome
last
year
under
the
preaching
of
padre
agostino

to


listen
to
a
very
remarkable
sermon
from
one
of
the
most
eloquent


preachers
in
france

canon
lemann
of
lyons

in
the
course
of
this
sermon


the
preacher
incidentally

but
with
an
obvious
and
courageous
purpose



dwelt
at
some
length
upon
the
energy
with
which
urban
ii

had
denounced


and
repressed
the

false
crusaders

who

under
cover
of
the
uprising
of


christendom
against
the
infidel

fell
upon

persecuted

and
massacred


the
jews
in
europe

this
quiet
and
earnest
protest
against
the



jew
baiting

tendency
which
is
showing
itself
in
france

as
well
as
in


germany

was
plainly
understood

and
as
plainly
commanded
the
sympathy


of
his
hearers

this
was
the
case
also
with
his
admirable
treatment
of


the
international
aspects
of
the
story
of
the
maid
of
orleans

there
was


not
a
trace
of
chauvinism
in
his
citation
of
the
simple
and
downright


message
sent
by
the
pucelle
to
the
english
before
orleans


i
have
been


sent
by
god
to
throw
you
out
of
france


out
of
france
she
did
throw


them


in
this


said
the
preacher


jeanne
d
arc
did
a
great
service
to


england
as
well
as
to
france

the
fair
haired
nation
of
the
north
had


fought
side
by
side
with
france

coeur
de
lion
with
philip
augustus



in
the
crusades

when

therefore

the
destined
queen
of
the
seas
sought


to
establish
herself
as
a
continental
power
in
the
heart
of
europe

the


lord
put
in
her
way
that
grain
of
star
dust
from
domremy

forced
her


back
to
her
vocation

and
bade
her
content
herself
with
being
sovereign


on
the
ocean







i
spoke
of
this
allusion
to
the
jews
with
a
most
accomplished


ecclesiastic
who
dined
at
the
archi
episcopal
palace

he
was
very
much


pleased
with
it


one
of
the
most
mischievous
things
done


he
said


by


the
present
government
is
that
it
is
certainly
fomenting

i
cannot
say


whether
ignorantly
or
wilfully

a
great
deal
of
popular
hostility
to
the


jews
by
giving
important
official
positions
to
men
who

though


israelites
by
blood

are
in
most
cases
no
better
israelites
than
they


are
christians

very
nearly
half
the
prefectures
in
france
are
filled
by


such
persons

when

as
is
too
often
the
case

they
carry
out
offensive


and
tyrannical
measures
against
the
catholic
schools
and
congregations


in
an
unnecessarily
offensive
and
tyrannical
manner

it
is
very
easy

as


you
must
see

for
hasty
or
malevolent
persons
to
persuade
the
people


that
they
do
this
because
they
are
jews

and
as
jews
hate
the


christians

i
know
that
the
best
israelites
in
france
regret
this
as


much
as
i
do

the
policy
of
this
government
is
aimed
as
clearly
at
the


extinction
of
the
jewish
as
of
the
christian
faith

at
the
grand
rabbis


as
mercilessly
as
at
the
archbishops
of
france







this
same
ecclesiastic
gave
me
some
particulars
of
the
virulence
with


which
the
anti
religious
war
is
waged

he
told
me
of
one
case
of
recent


date
in
paris
in
which
the
authorities
of
a
hospital
neglected
for
two


days
to
pay
any
heed
to
the
entreaties
of
a
poor
patient
that
they
would


send
for
a
priest
to
attend
him

the
doctors
having
given
him
to


understand
that
for
him
the
end
was
near

the
chaplains

it
will
be


remembered

have
been
expelled
from
all
the
public
hospitals

finally


some
person
in
charge
of
the
place

more
humane
than
his
fellows

sent


out
to
a
lazarist
house
in
the
neighbourhood
and
asked
the
lazarists
to


send
a
priest

the
priest
came

he
was
received
very
rudely

kept


waiting
a
long
time
in
an
ante
room

and
when
he
was
finally
conducted


through
the
wards
to
the
dying
man

all
sorts
of
vulgar
and
foolish


jeers
were
uttered
about
his
mission
as
he
passed
along

and
it
was
with


the
greatest
trouble
that
he
finally
succeeded
in
imposing
some
sort
of


decent
respect
for
the
death
bed
of
this
poor
sufferer
upon
the
hospital


attendants







this
is
the
spirit


said
the
priest
who
told
me
the
tale


of
the


commune

or
rather
of
those
communards
who
murdered
the
hostages

these


murderers
simply
put
this
spirit
into
deeds
instead
of
words

they
made


the
name
of
the
commune
so
odious
that
when
victor
hugo
in

proposed


a
general
amnesty
of
the
condemned
communards

the
chamber
rejected
it


without
taking
a
vote







in

the
same
general
amnesty
was
proposed

and
the
chamber
adopted


it
by
a
very
large
majority

do
you
wonder
that
thoughtful
men
look
with


horror
on
the
current
which
is
carrying
us
in
such
a
direction
as
that



at
this
moment
two
men
of
high
personal
character

admiral
krantz
and
m



casimir
perier

are
lending
their
support
to
a
government
which


represents
this
current

and
yet
admiral
krantz
and
m

casimir
perier


have
recorded
their
deliberate
conviction
that
the
men
who
clamoured
for


an
unconditional

indiscriminate
amnesty
for
the
communards
were
simply


abusing
the
name
of
clemency
for
the
rehabilitation
of
crime







look
again


he
said


at
the
spirit
in
which
the
laicization
of
the


schools
is
conducted

there
are
a
hundred
families
we
will
say
in
a


village

ninety
nine
of
these
families
are
christian
families

not


families
of
saints

i
wish
i
knew
such
a
village
as
that


but
christian


families

go
into
their
homes

and
you
will
see
the
crucifix
hanging
in


the
chambers

religious
prints
upon
the
walls

one
family
is
a
family
of


atheists

i
suppose
the
case

for
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
know
no
such


family

but
i
will
suppose
it

there
is
a
school
in
the
village

and
in


that
school
there
hangs
a
crucifix

the
gift
of
some
pious
resident



ninety
nine
fathers
and
mothers
of
the
village
desire
that
crucifix
to


be
respected

one
father
and
one
mother

a
bold
supposition
this




desire
it
to
be
removed

the
authorities
send
in
a
man
who
plucks
it


down

before
the
children

and
throws
it
out
of
the
door

i
simply
state


what
has
happened
over
and
over
again

is
there
any
respect
for
equal


rights

for
the
rule
of
the
majority

for
freedom
of
conscience
in
such


proceedings

take
the
case
of
the
virgin
of
beziers

in
that
ancient


city
stood
two
statues
of
the
virgin

one
in
bronze
and
one
in
marble



the
civil
authorities
called
upon
the
church
to
suppress
them

the


church
authorities
of
course
declined
to
do
this

thereupon
the
civil


authorities
take
the
money
of
the
taxpayers
and
expend
it
in
depriving


the
city
of
these
two
monuments

suppose
the
turkish
authorities
were
to


do
a
thing
like
this
in
a
town
full
of
christians
under
their
dominion



what
would
all
the
civilised
world
say
about
the
turks







and
it
is
done
in
a
french
city
by
frenchmen
either
to
carry
out
their


own
self
will
or
to
exasperate
and
insult
their
fellow
citizens

or
for


both
reasons
at
once







still
another
case
you
can
see
for
yourself
at
domremy

there
under
a


pious
and
patriotic
foundation
to
which
louis
xviii
largely
contributed


the
home
of
jeanne
d
arc

religiously
preserved
in
its
original
state



was
confided
to
the
keeping
of
some
sisters

they
dwelt
in
a
neat


edifice
constructed
on
the
grounds
purchased
to
secure
the
house
of
the


pucelle

and
there
the
children
of
domremy
and
the
neighbouring
communes


came
to
school
and
were
gratuitously
taught

only
the
other
day
the


local
authorities
were
instigated

i
know
not
by
whom

perhaps
by
the


friends
of
m

ferry
at
st

die

which
is
not
very
far
off

to

laicize



instruction
in
domremy

to
this
end
they
turn
the
sisters
out

put
the


home
of
jeanne
d
arc
under
the
charge
of
a
lay
guardian

who
has
to
be


paid
by
the
state

of
course

tax
the
commune
to
pay
a
lay
teacher

and


make
the
school
a
lay
school
at
the
very
door
of
the
home
of
the


village
maiden
to
whose
religious
faith
france
owes
her
freedom
and
her


national
existence







i
made
a
visit
to
nancy
and
the
department
of
the
meurthe
et
moselle
not


long
after
i
had
this
conversation
in
reims

the
mother
superior
of
the


great
sisterhood
of
christian
doctrine
at
nancy
confirmed
this
amazing


story
of
the
performances
at
domremy

and
gave
me
many
particulars
of


the
petty
persecutions
to
which
the
sisters
who
conduct
schools
all
over


france
are
subjected

the
schools
are
open
at
all
hours
to
the
invasion


of
inspectors

who
magnify
their
office
too
often
in
the
eyes
of
the


children
by
treating
the
teachers

lay
as
well
as
religious

with
the


sort
of
amiable
condescension
which
marks
the
demeanour
of
an
agent
of


the
octroi
overhauling
the
basket
of
a
peasant
woman
at
a
barrier

if
a


sister
has
a
religious
book

her
own
property

lying
on
her
desk

it
is


violently
snatched
up

and
the
children
are
invited
to
say
whether
it


has
been
used
to
poison
their
young
minds
with
religious
ideas


in


short


said
the
mother
superior
very
quietly


our
sisters
are
really


much
better
treated
in
protestant
countries
than
in
catholic
france







domremy
la
pucelle
is
a
typical
agricultural
village
of
eastern
france



it
is
in
the
department
of
the
vosges
and
in
the
verdant
valley
of
the


meuse

i
drove
to
it
on
a
lovely
summer
s
morning
after
visiting


vaucouleurs

where
the
pucelle
came
before
the
stout
captain
robert
de


beaudricourt
and
said
to
him


you
must
take
me
to
the
king

i
must
see


him
before
mid
lent

and
i
will
see
him
if
i
walk
my
legs
off
to
the


knees


this
interview
began
her
marvellous
career






from
certain
articles
in
newspapers
about
a
drama
of

jeanne
d
arc


now


performing
at
paris

i
gather
that
jeanne
s
moral
conquest
of
france


which
preceded
and
led
to
her
material
victory
over
the
english


invaders

has
at
last
been
satisfactorily
explained
by
the
scientific


believers
in
hypnotism

of
this
i
can
only
say

with
president
lincoln


on
a
memorable
occasion


for
those
who
like
this
kind
of
explanation
of


historical
phenomena

i
should
suppose
it
would
be
just
the
kind
of


explanation
they
would
like







the
country
between
vaucouleurs
and
domremy
is
agreeably
diversified



well
wooded
in
parts

and
rich
in
fair
meadow
lands

at
montbras
a


little
old
lady
dwells
and
looks
after
her
affairs
in
one
of
the
most


picturesque
chateau
of
the
sixteenth
century
to
be
seen
in
this
part
of


france

machicolated

crenellated

and
dominated
by
lofty
towers

we


passed

too

through
greux

a
small
village
on
the
meuse

the
dwellers


in
which
were
astute
enough
to
get
themselves
exempted
by
charles
vii


from
all
talliages
and
subsidies

by
fabricating
documents

to
prove


that
jeanne
d
arc
was
born
there

the
incident
is
curious
as
going
to


show
that
the

downtrodden
serfs

and

manacled
villeins

of
the
middle


ages
had
their
wits
about
them

and
could
take
care
of
themselves
when


an
opportunity
offered

as
well
as
the

oppressed
tenantry

of
modern


ireland

domremy

which
is
no
bigger
than
greux

neither
of
them
having


three
hundred
inhabitants

straggles
along
the
highway

the
houses
are


well
built

the
church
is
a
handsome

ogival
building
of
the
fifteenth


century

restored
in
our
day

but
quite
in
keeping
with
the
place
and


its
associations

within
it

under
a
tomb
built
into
the
wall

lie
the


two
brothers
tiercelin

sons
of
the
godmother
of
jeanne

who
bore
their


testimony
manfully
to
the
character
of
the
deliverer
of
france

when
the


church
was
at
last
compelled
to
intervene
in
the
interest
of
truth
and


justice
between
the
french
catholics
who
had
worshipped
her
as
a



creature
of
god


and
the
english
catholics
who
had
burned
her
as
an


emissary
of
the
evil
one






almost
under
the
shadow
of
the
church
tower
stands
the
house
in
which


jeanne
was
born
and
bred

a
charming

old
fashioned
garden

very
well


kept

surrounds
it

if
when
you
leave
the
church
you
pass
around
by
the


main
street
of
the
village

you
soon
find
yourself
in
front
of
a
neat


iron
railing
which
connects
two
modern
buildings
of
no
great
size

but


neat
and
unpretending

entering
the
gateway
of
this
railing
you
see


before
you

shaded
by
well
grown
trees

one
or
two
of
which
may
possibly


be
of
the
date
of
the
house

the
quaint
fifteenth
century
facade
of
the


house
of
jacques
d
arc

and
his
wife
isabelle
vouthon

called
romee


because
she
had
made
a
pilgrimage
to
the
eternal
city

a
curious


demi
gable
gives
the
house
the
appearance
of
having
been
cut
in
two

but


there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
it
was
ever
any
larger
than
it
is
now



probably

indeed

this
facade
was
erected
long
after
the
martyrdom
of


jeanne

over
the
ogival
doorway
is
an
escutcheon
showing
three
shields



and
the
date



with
an
inscription



vive
labeur

vive
le
roy


louys



this
goes
to
confirm
a
local
tradition
that
the
facade
was


built
at
the
cost
of
louis
xi


who
understood
much
better
than
his


father
the
political
value
to
the
crown
and
to
the
country
of
france
of


the
marvellous
career
of
the
peasant
girl
of
domremy

the
date
of
this


inscription
is
particularly
significant

in

was
fought
the
battle


of
guinegate

which
was
lost
to
france
by
the
headlong
flight
of
the


french
chivalry
from
the
field

louis
xi

turned
this
disaster
to
good


account

he
made
it
the
excuse
for
founding

in


his
regular
army


of
mercenaries

liberating
the
peasants
from
the
burden
of
personal


military
service
to
the
lords

and
drawing
to
himself
the
power
of
the


state
through
taxation



vive
labeur

vive
le
roy
louys



was
a


popular
cry
throughout
france
in


for
labeur
in
those
days
meant


what
it
means
now
in
the

terra
di
lavoro


the
tilling
of
the
fields



one
of
the
three
shields
above
this
doorway
has
a
similar
significance



it
is
a
bearing
of
three
ploughshares

with
it
are
emblazoned
on
the


house
of
the
pucelle
two
other
shields

one
bearing
the
three
royal


fleurs
de
lys
of
france

and
the
other
the
arms
granted
to
the
family
of


the
heroine


azure


a
sword

argent

pommelled
and
hilted

or


and


above
a
crown
supported
by
two
fleurs
de
lys

with
these
arms

as


we
know

the
family
took
the
name
of
de
lys

the
name

the
arms

and
the


inscription
over
the
doorway
were
a
perpetual
witness
to
the
peasants
of


champagne
and
lorraine
of
the
unity
of
interests
established
by
king


louis
between
the
spade
and
the
sceptre

with
the
help
of
an
inspired


daughter
of
the
people

king
charles
had
driven
the
english
into
the


sea

and
delivered
the
land

with
the
help
of
the
people

king
louis
had


broken
the
power
of
burgundy

and
put
the
barons
under
his
foot



vive


labeur

vive
le
roy
louys



i
do
not
wonder
this
skilful
craftsman

of


the
empire
and
the
rule

lamented
on
his
death
bed
in


at


plessis
les
tours

that
he
could
not
live
to
crown
the
edifice
he
had
so


well
begun

we
in
england
and
america
know
him
only
in
the
magic
mirror


of
the
wizard
of
the
north

but
france
owes
him
a
great
debt

he
was


cruel

but
in
comparison
with
the
cruelty
of
lebon

of
barere

of


billaud
varennes

his
cruelty
was
tender
mercy

he
was
a
hypocrite

but


his
hypocrisy
shows
like
candour
beside
the
perfidy
and
the
cant
of


petion
and
of
robespierre

while
in
the
great

art
and
mystery

of


government
he
was
a
master
where
these
modern
apes
of
despotism
were


clumsy
apprentices






the
interior
of
the
house
of
jeanne
is
probably
in
the
main
what
it
was


when
jeanne
dwelt
here
with
her
parents

her
sister
and
her
brothers



the
ground
floor
contains
a
general
living
room

the
large
chimney
place


of
which
may
perhaps
be
of
the
time
of
jeanne

and
three
bedrooms

one


of
which

a
chamber
measuring
three
metres
by
four

and
lighted
only
by


a
small
dormer
window
looking
out
upon
the
garden

tradition
assigns
to


jeanne
and
to
her
sister

here

the
people
of
domremy
believe

the


maiden
sate
almost
within
the
shadow
of
the
old
church
tower

and
heard


the
voices
of
st

catherine
and
st

margaret

and
michael
the
archangel



patron
and
defender
of
france

mingling
with
the
sound
of
the
church


bells

and
calling
upon
her
to
arise

and
leave
her
village
home
and
the


still
forests
of
domremy
and
her
silly
sheep

and
go
out
into
a
world
of


war
and
confusion
and
violence

and
rally
the
broken
armies
of
her


people

and
lead
them

like
another
deborah
or
judith

to
victory






that
jeanne
heard
these
voices
or
believed
she
heard
them

the


documentary
evidence
unearthed
by
quicherat
abundantly
proves

it


proves

too

that
she
was
cool

clear
headed

self
possessed

thoroughly


honest

and
absolutely
trustworthy
in
every
relation
of
life

this
being


her
character

what
did
she
do

she
made
her
way
from
her
solitude
in


lorraine
to
the
court
of
the
king
at
chinon

with
nothing
but
her
faith


in
her
voices
and
her
mission
to
sustain
her

put
herself
into
the


forefront
of
the
battle
of
france

threw
the
english
back
into
england



and
saw
the
successor
of
st

remi
put
the
crown
of
clovis
upon
the
head


of
a
prince
whom
nobody
but
herself
could
have
led
or
driven
to
reims






if
anybody
in
paris
or
elsewhere
knowing
all
this
feels
quite
sure
that


jeanne
did
not
hear
the
voices
which
she
believed
herself
to
have


heard

he
certainly
is
to
be
pitied

it
may
do
him
good
to
consider
in


his
closet
what
lord
macaulay
has
said
in
a
certain
celebrated
essay


concerning
sir
thomas
more
and
the
doctrine
of
transubstantiation






a
man
may
intelligently
believe
or
disbelieve
in
the
reality
of
the


voices
heard
by
jeanne

but
no
man
who
intelligently
disbelieves
in
them


can
need
to
be
told
that
his
disbelief
rests
upon
no
better
scientific


ground
than
the
belief
of
the
man
who
believes
in
them






to
take
the
home
of
jeanne
d
arc
out
of
the
keeping
of
devout
women
who


share
the
faith
of
jeanne

that
faith
which

well
or
ill
founded



unquestionably
saved
france

was
simply
a
stupid
indecency

in
the


keeping
of
the
sisters
the
home
of
jeanne
was
a
shrine

in
any
other


keeping
it
becomes
a
show






the
essential
vulgarity
of
the
performance
is
bad
enough

but
a


sharp
witted
domremy
man
who
took
me
on
to
bourlemont
in
his

trap



assured
me

in
a
matter
of
fact
way

that
in
the
village
the
chief
mover


in
the
affair
was
commonly
believed
to
have
got
a
good

pot
de
vin

for


securing
the
position
of
keeper
of
the
house
for
a
person
of
his


acquaintance

this
may
have
been
a
bit
of
village
scandal

but
such


performances
naturally
breed
village
scandals

whether
it
was
or
was
not


a

job

in
this
sense

it
certainly
marks
as
low
a
level
of
taste
and


education
as
the
pillage
by
barere
and
his
copper

syndicate

of
the


historic
tombs
of
france
at
st

denis
in







some
years
ago
all
france
was
incensed
by
a
nocturnal
desecration
of
the


statue
of
duguesclin
which
stands
at
dinan
in
the
very
lists
in
which


five
hundred
years
ago
the
breton
hero
met
and
vanquished

sir
thomas
of


canterbury


the
indignation
of
france
was
righteous

and
if
there
was


any
foundation
for
the
popular
impression
that
the
outrage
was


perpetrated
by
some
english
lads
on
a
vacation
tour

no
language
could


well
be
too
strong
to
apply
to
it

but
i
did
not
observe
that
any


parisian
journalist
alluded
at
that
time
to
the
way
in
which
the
ashes


of
duguesclin
himself
were
treated
in

at
st

denis

by
frenchmen


decked
in
tri
coloured
scarves

it
did
not
even
occur
to
them
to


remember
how
long
ago
and
by
what
hands
the
column
of
the
grand
army
was


pulled
down
in
the
very
heart
of
paris






while
the
force
of
philistine
fatuity
can
no
further
go
than
it
has
gone


in
the

laicization

of
the
home
of
jeanne
d
arc

i
ought
to
say
that


the
actual
keeper
of
the
place
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
decent
sort
of


fellow

not
wholly
destitute
of
respect
for
its
traditions
and
its


significance

the
house
and
the
garden
are
neatly
kept

in
the
centre
of


the
main
room
stands
a
fine
model
in
bronze
of
the
well
known
statue
of


jeanne
d
arc

by
the
princess
mary
of
orleans

with
an
inscription


stating
that
it
was
given
by
the
king

her
father

to
the
department
of


the
vosges

to
be
placed
in
the
house
where
jeanne
was
born



commemorative
tablets
are
set
here
and
there
in
the
walls

and
in
one
of


the
modern
buildings
in
front
of
the
house
a
collection
is
kept
of


objects
illustrating
the
life
of
the
pucelle






the
most
interesting
of
these
is
a
banner
given
by
general
de
charette



to
the
valour
of
whose
zouaves
the
french
are
indebted
for
one
of
the


few
gleams
of
victory
which
brighten
up
the
dark
record
of

it
was


at
patay
that
in
june

the
english

under
sir
john
fastolf

for
the


first
time
broke
in
a
stricken
field
and
fled
under
the
onset
of
the


french

led
by
the
maid
of
orleans

leaving
the
great
talbot
to
fall
a


prisoner
into
the
hands
of
his
enemies

and
at
patay

again
in
december




the
german
advance
was
met
and
repulsed
by
the

volunteers
of
the


west


that
being
the
name
under
which
the
silly
and
intolerant



government
of
the
national
defence

actually
compelled
the
catholic


zouaves
to
fight
for
their
country

just
as
they
forced
the
duc
de


chartres
to
draw
his
sword
and
risk
his
life
for
france
as

robert


lefort


these
puerilities
really
almost
disarm
contempt
into


compassion

at
patay
in

the
zouaves
saw
three
of
their
officers



all
of
one
family

struck
down
in
succession

two
of
them
to
death

as


they
advanced
on
the
lines
of
the
enemy

bearing
a
banner
of
the


sacre
coeur

which
had
been
presented
to
general
de
charette
by
some


nuns
of
brittany
only
a
few
days
before
the
battle

the
banner

now
at


domremy

is
a
votive
offering
of
general
de
charette
and
his
zouaves
in


commemoration
of
the
field
on
which
they
were
permitted
thus

after
four


centuries

to
link
the
piety
and
the
patriotic
valour
of
modern
france


with
the
deathless
traditions
of
domremy

of
orleans

and
of
reims






this
little
museum
contains

too

a
picture
given
by
an
englishman

of


jeanne
binding
up
the
wounds
of
an
english
soldier
after
the
repulse
of


one
of
the
english
attacks

the
soil
has
risen
about
the
house
of


jeanne

and
this
may
have
made
the
interior
seem
more
gloomy
than
it


once
was

but
the
house
is
well
and
solidly
built

and
if
it
may
be


thought
a
fair
specimen
of
the
abodes
of
the
well
to
do
peasantry
of


lorraine
in
the
fifteenth
century

they
were
as
well
lodged
relatively


to
the
general
average
of
people
at
that
time
as
those
of
the
same
class


in
eastern
france
now
on
the
average
appear
to
be

charles
de
lys
in
the


early
seventeenth
century
seems
to
have
been
a
man
of
note
and


substance

but
the
parents
of
jeanne
were
simply
peasant
proprietors

at


the
entrance
of
the
village
church
there
is
a
statue
of
jeanne

the
work


of
a
native
artist

in
which
she
appears
kneeling
in
her
peasant
s


dress

one
hand
pressed
upon
her
heart
and
the
other
lifted
towards


heaven

and
in
a
little
clump
of
fir
trees
near
her
house
stands
a
sort


of
monumental
fountain

surmounted
by
a
bust
of
the
pucelle

the
house


itself
remained
in
the
possession
of
the
last
descendant
of
the
family



a
soldier
of
the
empire
named
gerardin

down
to
the
time
of
the


restoration

some
englishman

it
is
said

then
offered
him
a
handsome


price
for
the
cottage

with
the
object
of
moving
it
across
the
channel



as
an
enterprising
countryman
of
mine
once
proposed
to
carry
off
the


house
of
shakespeare
to
america

gerardin

though
a
poor
man

or
perhaps


because
he
was
a
poor
man

refused

the
department
thereupon
bought
the


house

the
king
gave
gerardin
the
cross
of
the
legion

and
he
was
made
a



garde
forestier







upon
the
expulsion
of
the
sisters
from
the
home
of
la
pucelle

some
of


the
most
respectable
people
in
the
department
at
once
organized
a
fund



and
built
for
them
a
very
neat
edifice
in
the
village
in
which
they
are


now
installed

fully
four
fifths
of
the
children
of
the
country
round


about

i
was
told

still
attend
their
free
school


ah

sir


said
a


cheery
solid
farmer
of
domremy
to
me

while
i
stood
waiting
for
my



trap


to
continue
my
journey


it
does
not
amuse
us
at
all
to
pay
for


the
braying
of
all
these
donkeys

do
you
know

it
costs
domremy

such
as


you
see
it

twelve
hundred
francs
a
year

this
nonsense
about
the


sisters
and
the
house
of
la
pucelle

and
to
what
use

what
harm
did
the


sisters
do
there

it
is
not
the
pucelle
who
would
have
put
them
out

do


you
think

in
the
old
time
domremy
paid
no
taxes
because
of
the
pucelle



now
because
of
the
pucelle
we
must
pay
twelve
hundred
francs
a
year
for


what
we
don
t
want







some
of
my
readers
may
thank
me

as
the
guide
book
gives
no
very


accurate
information
on
the
subject

for
telling
them
that


domremy
la
pucelle
may
be
very
easily

and
in
fine
weather
very


pleasantly

visited
from
neufchateau
on
the
railway
line
between
paris


and
mirecourt

neufchateau
itself
is
an
interesting
and
picturesque


town

it
suffered
severely
from
the
religious
wars

but
two
of
its


churches

st

christopher
and
st

nicholas

are
worth
seeing

there
are


two
very
good
statues
of
jeanne
d
arc

and
the
hotel
de
la
providence



kept
by
a
most
attentive
dame

is
a
very
good
specimen
of
a
small
french


provincial
inn

there
a
carriage
can
be
had
for
domremy

and
with
a


luncheon
basket
a
summer
s
day
may
be
most
agreeably
spent
between


neufchateau
and
the
little
station
of
domremy
maxey
sur
meuse

at
which


point

about
three
miles
beyond
domremy
la
pucelle

you
may
strike
the


railway
which
leads
to
nancy

the
old
capital
of
lorraine

though
not


nearly
so
trim
and
well
kept
as
it
used
to
be

is
still
one
of
the
most


characteristic
and
interesting
cities
in
france






very
near
domremy
la
pucelle

a
resident
of
the
country

m

sedille

has


built

on
a
fine
hill
overlooking
the
valley
of
the
meuse

a
small


chapel
adorned
with
a
group
representing
the
maiden
kneeling
before
her


saints
and
the
archangel

this
chapel
stands
on
the
place
where

as


tradition
tells
us

jeanne
first
heard
the
heavenly

voices


it
was


then
in
the
heart
of
a
great
forest

long
since
thinned
away

it
now


commands
a
wide
and
beautiful
view
of
a
finely
varied
country

there



driving
from
bourlemont
on
a
lovely
summer
afternoon

i
found
a
young


pilgrim
from
the
far
west
of
the
united
states
doing
homage
to
the


memory
of
the
maid
of
orleans

he
had
made
his
way
here
from
paris
and


the
exposition


i
got
enough
of
that


he
said


in
about
three
days



with
the
help
of
a
french
conversation
book


his
method
was
to
look
up


a
phrase
as
nearly
as
possible
expressing
what
he
wanted
to
say

and


then
to
submit
this
phrase
in
the
book
to
his
interlocutor


how
do
you


find
the
plan
work


i
asked
him


oh

very
well


he
replied


the


french
are
so
very
obliging

i
m
afraid
it
wouldn
t
work
as
well
the


other
way

on
our
side
of
the
pond


his
worship

not
of
heroes

but
of


heroines

was
most
simple
and
downright


i
consider
joan
of
arc


he


said


the
greatest
woman
that
ever
walked
the
earth

and
next
to
her


charlotte
corday

and
these
miserable
englishmen
burnt
one


he
added


scornfully


and
these
miserable
frenchmen
guillotined
the
other

i


don
t
wonder
this
old
world
is
played
out
if
they
can
t
treat
such
women


better
than
that







he
was
charmed
with
the
story
of
adam
lux

caricatured
by
mr

carlyle




who

like
andre
chenier

invited
death
by
his
defiant
homage
to


charlotte
corday


well
now

i
suppose


he
said


that
if
there
had


been
fifty
more
men
in
paris
then
as
brave
as
that
adam
lux

they
could


have
taken
all
those
cowards
and
murderers
and
chucked
them
into
the


seine


he
rejoiced
over
the
bishop
of
verdun
s
projected
monument
to


jeanne

and
i
sent
him
to
chatillon
by
telling
him
that
the
statue
of


urban
ii

stands
third
in
height
among
the
religious
monuments
of
europe


after
the
virgin
of
le
puy
and
the
st

charles
of
arona






bourlemont
before
the
revolution
must
have
been
one
of
the
finest


chateaux
in
france

it
stands
superbly
on
the
plateau
of
a
lofty
hill



the
park
which
surrounds
it
is
very
extensive
and
full
of
noble
trees



the
chateau
was
sacked
and
pillaged

and
one
great
wing
destroyed

this


the
prince
d
henin
is
now
rebuilding
on
the
original
scale

and
in
the


most
perfect
keeping
with
the
stately
and
picturesque
main
body
of
the


edifice

the
whole
of
the
interior

with
the
great
hall
and
the
chapel



has
been
restored
and
refurnished
with
admirable
taste

carved
oak


wainscotings
of
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries

antique


armoires
and
cabinets
and
tables

mediaeval
tapestries

nothing
is


wanting

but
the
thoroughness
of
the
reconstruction
emphasizes
the


wanton
folly
and
wickedness
of
the
devastation
which
made
it
necessary






the
princesse
d
henin
of
the
revolutionary
time
narrowly
escaped
the


guillotine

she
was
one
of
many
women
of
rank
and
worth
who
owed
their


lives
to
the
courage
and
ability
and
generosity
of
madame
de
stael



after
taking
refuge
in
switzerland

madame
de
stael
organised
a
complete


system
for
bringing
away
her
imperilled
friends
from
paris

she
gathered


about
her
a
small
corps
of
clever
and
determined
swiss
girls

these
she


sent
one
by
one
as
occasion
served

or
circumstances
required

into


france

equipped
with
swiss
passports

on
reaching
paris
one
of
these


girls
would
find
a
lady
waiting
to
escape

change
wardrobes
with
her



give
her
a
swiss
passport
properly
vised
by
the
swiss
representative
in


paris

furnish
her
with
money
if
necessary

and
set
her
safely
on
her


way
to
the
cantons

when
news
came
that
she
had
arrived

the
swiss


damsel
in
her
turn
would
get
a
new
passport
from
her
minister
and
return


to
switzerland

of
course

such
a
system
as
this
could
not
have
been


carried
out
so
successfully
as
it
was
without
more
or
less
co
operation


on
the
part
of
the

incorruptible

republican
functionaries
in
france



and
there
can
be
little
doubt
that

under
the
regime
of
the
scoundrels


who
made
up
the
committee
of
public
security

lebon

panis

drouet



ruhl

and
the
rest

a
regular
traffic
in
passports
and
protections
went


on
during
the
worst
times
of
the
terror

it
is
remembered
to
the
credit


of
an
unhappy
woman

who
was
born
in
the
town
of
vaucouleurs

and
for


whom
nobody
finds
a
good
word

madame
du
barry

that
she
deliberately


gave
up
the
certainty
of
securing
her
own
escape
from
paris

in


in


order
to
save
madame
de
mortemart

the
duchesse
de
mortemart
was
in


hiding
on
the
channel
coast

when
madame
du
barry

for
whom
a


safe
conduct
under
an
assumed
name
had
been
bought
from
one
of
the


terrorist

titans


insisted
that
this
safe
conduct
should
be
sent
from


paris
to
the
duchesse

the
duchesse
used
it
and
reached
england
in


safety

madame
du
barry
remained
to
perish
on
the
scaffold

leaving
her


goods
and
chattels
to
be
stolen
by
the
ruffians
who
sent
her
to
the


guillotine

just
as
the
goods
and
chattels

the
money
and
equipments
and


horses
of
the
duc
de
biron
were
stolen
by
the
republican

general



rossignol

his
successor






domremy
is
in
the
electoral
district
of
neufchateau

and
the
elections


of

do
not
show
that
the

laicization

policy
has
given
the


republican
cause
a
great
impulse
in
this
region

the
monarchist


candidate
in
the
neufchateau
district
received
in
september





votes

and
the
republican



this
is
one
of
the
microscopic


majorities
which
were
so
common
in


and
which
conclusively
show


what
a
difference
in
the
general
result
was
made
by
the
open
pressure
of


the
government
on
the
electors

the
department
of
the
vosges
sends
up


six
deputies
to
the
chamber

in

it
sent
up
a
solid
republican


deputation

including
m

meline

who
was
so
conspicuous
in

in
the


matter
of
general
boulanger
and
m

jules
ferry

the
standard
bearer
of



laicization

and
irreligion

in

the
deputies
were
chosen
by
the



scrutin
de
liste


the
republican
majority
shown
by
the
vote
for
m



meline
was


on
a
total
poll
of



m

meline

who
headed
the


poll

received


votes

his
conservative
opponent
received





in

the
elections
were
made
by
the

scrutin
d
arrondissement


five


republicans

not
six

were
chosen

and
the
defeated
republican
candidate


was
no
less
a
person
than
m

jules
ferry
himself

the
first
district
of


st

die
gave
him


votes

and
elected
a
monarchist
to
replace
him
by




votes

it
is
not
easy
to
overestimate
the
significance
of
this


change

probably
enough
the
majority
will
emphasize
it
by

invalidating



the
election
of
the
monarchist






a
comparison
of
the
total
votes
in
the
vosges
of
the
two
parties
in



with
those
of

is
instructive

in

the
strength

of
the
two


parties
respectively

the
conservatives
not
having
then
openly
declared


for
the
monarchy

was

as
i
have
said



and



in

the


republicans
polled
in
all
the
districts
of
the
department


votes



and
their
opponents



here
we
have
a
falling
off
of

votes
in


the
highest
republican
strength
against
an
increase
of


in
the


highest
opposition
strength

or

in
other
words

a
falling
off
of




votes
in
the
aggregate
republican
majority

together
with
the
defeat
in


his
own
district
of
the
recognised
leader
of
the
republican
government


party

and
yet
the
total
of
the
votes
polled
rose
from


in

to




in


the
inference
is
obvious

that
the
monarchists
are
on


the
upgrade

and
the
republicans
on
the
downgrade

if

with
such
results


in
such
a
region
and
in
the
face
of
such
a
contest
as
that
of


the


monarchists
do
not
in
the
long
run
win

it
will
clearly
be
nobody
s


fault
but
their
own















chapter
xiv





in
the
calvados










val
richer






perhaps
the
most
striking
illustration
that
can
be
given
of
the
true


nature
of
the
contest
now
waging
between
the
third
republic
and
france



is
the
share
taken
in
it
by
the
family
and
the
representatives
of
the


great
protestant
statesman

who

under
louis
philippe

laid
down
the


lines
in
france
of
a
truly
free
and
liberal
system
of
public
education



in
the
matter
of
education
france
was
undoubtedly
thrown
backward
and


not
forward
by
the
first
republic

the
number
of
illiterates

that
is



of
persons
unable
to
read
and
write

naturally
increased
between



and

as
the
educational
foundations
which
existed
all
over
the


kingdom
shared
the
fate
of
the
religious
and
charitable
foundations



there
was
an
abundance
of
ordinances
and
decrees
about
public
education



but
the
chief
practical
work
done
was
to
confiscate
the
means
by
which


the
ancient
system
had
been
carried
on

baudrillart
mentions
educational


foundations
made
by
the
great
abbeys
as
early
as
in
the
seventh
century



in
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries

councils
of
the
french
church


created
in
each
cathedral
chapter
a
special
prebend

the
holder
of
which


was
to
look
after
the
education
not
only
of
clerical
persons

but

of


all
poor
scholars


and
this

gratuitously







in
the
fourteenth
century
lay
foundations
for
free
public
education
are


found

one
in
particular
of
importance
established
by
a
rich
citizen



jean
rose

for
promoting
the
general
education
of
the
people
at
meaux



the
diocese
afterwards
of
bossuet

who
under
louis
xiv

was
so
active
in


promoting

the
moral
unity

of
france
from
his
point
of
view






the
long
english
wars
interrupted
the
development
of
education

and
many


instances

these
were


hardly
the
men

the


educational

of

merlin

of
douai


minister
of
justice
under
the
quintette

really
ruled


france
for
nearly
five
years

this
was
merlin

author
of
the

law
of
the


suspects


which
mr

carlyle

though
obviously
in
the
dark
as
to
its


real
genesis
and
objects

finds
himself
constrained
to
stigmatize
as
the



frightfullest
law
that
ever
ruled
in
a
nation
of
men


mr

carlyle
does


not
seem
to
have
observed
that
the
author
of
this

transcendental

law



the
aim
of
which
was
to
convert
the
french
people
into
a
swarm
of
spies


and
assassins

was
not
only
one
of
the
first
of
the
republican

titans



to
fall
down
and
kiss
the
feet
of
napoleon

but
one
of
the
first
also
to


desert
napoleon

and
embrace
the
knees
of
the
returning
king

on
april






this
creature

who
had
caused
the
convention
to
reject
a


petition
for
a
pardon
presented
by
a
man
condemned
for
a
crime

the
real


authors
of
which
had
confessed
his
innocence
and
their
own
guilt

on
the


ground
that

every
sentence
pronounced
by
the
law
should
be


irrevocable


joined
in
a
most
fulsome
address
of
welcome
to
the


legitimate
sovereign
of
france

his
namesake
merlin

of
thionville




another

titan

whom
mr

carlyle
admires
as
riding
out
of
captured


mayence
still

threatening
in
defeat


was
nimbler
even
than
merlin
of


douai

on
april




he
wrote
to
king
louis
begging
to
be
allowed



to
serve
the
true

paternal
government
of
france







concerning
merlin

of
douai


barras

who
made
him

minister
of


justice


placidly
says


poltroons
are
always
cruel

merlin
always
hid


himself
in
the
moment
of
danger

and
came
out
again
only
to
strike
the


vanquished
party


proscription
and
confiscation
kept
the
government


which
this
worthy
republican
directed
much
too
busy
to
leave
it
any
time


for
looking
after
the
schools
of
france






when
at
last
napoleon
gathered
up
the
reins

he
postponed
the
interests


of
public
education
to
other

and
from
his
point
of
view
more
pressing



concerns






the
concordat
re
established
the
church
in
france

but
it
did
not


re
endow
the
church
on
a
scale
which
would
have
enabled
it
at
once
to


reconstruct
its
own
educational
system

in
fact

the
concordat
can


hardly
be
said
to
have
re
endowed
the
church
at
all

under
the


thirteenth
article
the
pope
formally
recognized
the
title
of
the


purchasers
of

national
property

in
france
to
vast
domains

the


property
through
purchase

donations

or
bequest
of
the
church

which


had
been
made

national
property

only
by
the
simple
processes
of


exiling
or
murdering
the
owners
and
confiscating
their
estates

in


consideration
of
this
recognition

the
state
bound
itself
by
article


xiv

of
the
concordat
to

ensure
to
the
bishops
and
the
curates
salaries


befitting
their
functions


and
by
article
xv

to

protect
the
right
of


the
catholics
of
france
to
re
endow
the
churches







as
to
the

rising
generation

of
the
french
people
the
government
of


napoleon
concerned
itself
much
more
with
the
conscription
than
with
the


reconstruction
of
the
schools

and
though
the
churches

both
catholic


and
protestant

took
this
work
in
hand
very
early
in
the
century

it
was


necessarily
with
inadequate
means






under
the
first
consulate
a
general
law
regulating
public
instruction


was
enacted

on
may




another
was
enacted
shortly
afterwards



and
in

appeared
the
famous
decree
of
the
emperor
founding
the


university
system
of
france

heaven
knows
how
many
schemes
for
founding


this
university
system
had
been
elaborated
and
submitted
to
him
before



only
to
be
torn
up
as

ideological


cuvier
affirms
that
he
drew
up


twenty
three
such
schemes
one
after
another






this
decree
of
march




forbade
the
establishment
of
private


schools
without
the
authority
of
the
government

set
up
three
degrees
of


public
instruction

primary

secondary
and
superior

organised
a
body
of


inspectors
general

and

in
short


laicized

public
education
in
france


effectually
as
a
machine
to
be
controlled
by
the
imperial
government






under
the
ancient
monarchy

france
possessed
twenty
four
universities



the
convention
suppressed
them
all
at
a
blow
on
september




this


was
little
more
than
three
months
after
the
convention
itself
had
been



suppressed

and
forced
to
kiss
the
hand
that
smote
it
by
henriot
and


his
cannoniers
on
june




a
law
abolishing
the
freedom
of


education
was
to
have
been
expected
from
an
assembly
itself
enslaved
by


an
oligarchy
of
rogues
and
assassins

and
this
law
left
nothing
standing


in
france
to
impede
the
execution
of
the
imperial
decree
of


the


first
article
of
which
was



public
education
in
the
whole
empire
is


exclusively
confided
to
the
university


another
article
ordained
that


all
the
schools
in
france
should
take
as
the
basis
of
their
instruction



fidelity
to
the
emperor

to
the
imperial
monarchy

the
trustee
of
the


happiness
of
the
people

and
to
the
napoleonic
dynasty

the
conservator


of
the
unity
of
france
and
of
all
the
liberal
ideas
proclaimed
in
the


constitutions
of
france


the
theology
of
all
the
french
schools
was
to


be
in
conformity
with
the
royal
edict
of
louis
xiv


issued
in




furthermore
and
expressly


the
members
of
the
university
were
required


to
keep
the
grand
master
and
his
officers
informed
of
anything
that
may


come
to
their
knowledge
contrary
to
the
doctrine
and
the
principles
of


the
educational
body
in
the
establishments
of
public
education







here
we
have
the

moral
unity

of
france
organized
by
napoleon
in



on
the
lines
in
which
the
third
republic
has
been
trying
ever
since



to
organize
it

put
the
word

republic

for
the
word

empire


the


phrase

scientific
atheism

for
the
phrase

propositions
of
the
clergy


of
france
in



and
you
have
in
the
napoleonic
organization
of


public
education
the
organization
controlled
by
m

jules

of
the


two
despotisms

the
despotism
of

seems
to
me
the
more
compatible


with
public
order
and
public
prosperity

with
public
liberty
neither
of


them
is
compatible

under
the
ancient
monarchy
and
the
clerical
system


of
education
liberty
existed

the
jesuits
and
the
jansenists

the


dominicans
and
the
oratorians
and
the
benedictines

had
their
different


principles
of
education

their
different
traditions

their
different


text
books

under
the
imperial
university

and
still
more
under
the


university
of
the
third
republic

differences
became
disloyalties

under


the
university
of
france
in

every
young
french
citizen
was
to


accept
the
catholic
faith
as
defined
by
the
clergy
of
france
in




and
true
allegiance
bear
to
the
napoleonic
dynasty

under
the
university


of
france
in


every
young
french
citizen
is
to
disbelieve
in
god


and
a
future
life

and
true
allegiance
bear
to
the
third
french


republic






in

as
in

the
rights
of
freemen
were
first
vindicated
in
this


connection
by
the
catholic
church

on
april




the
emperor
issued


a
decree
that
no
one
should
be
admitted
to
a
catholic
theological


academy
without
a
bachelor
s
diploma
of
the
university

the
bishops
came


at
once
into
collision
on
this
point
with
the
imperial
prefects
of




as
the
bishops
now
came
into
collision
on
the
decree
of

with
m



jules
ferry
and
the
republican
prefects

the
imperial
prefects
of




not
a
few
of
them
rabid
republicans
in


were
merely
the
valets
of


the
emperor

as
the
prefects
of

are
the
valets
of
a
parliamentary


oligarchy






the
emperor
carried
his
point

but
when
the
emperor
fell

and
the


constitutional
monarchy
was
restored

the
university
of
france
ceased
to


be
an
imperialist
training
school

m

de
fontanes

appointed


grand
master
by
the
emperor
in


kept
his
place
under
louis
xviii



to
keep
it
he
made
the
university

clerical


under
napoleon
the


scholars
in
the
public
schools
of
france
had
been
divided
into



companies


m

de
fontanes
in

ordered
them
to
be
divided
into



classes


under
napoleon
the
hours
of
study
and
of
play
were
announced


by
a
drum

in

m

de
fontanes
ordered
them
to
be
announced
by
a


bell

under
napoleon
the
boys
all
wore
a
uniform

m

de
fontanes
in



ordered
the
uniforms
to
be
no
longer
of

a
military
type


then
the


french
liberals
who
had
not
dared
to
stir
under
the
emperor
began
to


attack
both
the
clergy
and
the
university

but
when
the
revolution
of



brought
these

liberals

into
power

they
ceased
at
once
to
attack



and
began
at
once
to
engineer
the
imperial
machinery
of
the
university



m

thiers
even
proclaimed
this
machinery
to
be

the
finest
creation
of


the
reign
of
napoleon







in

the
truest
liberal
of
them
all

m

guizot

struck
a
strenuous


blow
at
this
machinery
of
despotism

he
could
not
deal
with
the


university
as
a
system

but
he
framed
a
law
affecting

primary


education


the
principle
of
winch
was
that
no
man
should
be
forced
to


send
his
child
to
school

but
that
schools
should
exist
all
over
france


to
which
any
man
who
pleased
might
send
his
children
if
he
was
too
poor


to
pay
for
their
education






this
principle
of
m

guizot
in

was
certainly
not
an
outcome
of
the



principles
of



for
it
had
been
at
the
foundation
of
all
the
free


schools
of
france
during
the
middle
ages

and
under
the
absolute


monarchy
of
louis
xiv

talleyrand
recognised
it
in
his
plan
of




which
did
not
suit
condorcet
and
his

ideologists


it
was
not
in
the


mere
revival
of
this
principle
that
the
true
liberalism
of
m

guizot


manifested
itself

in
the
second
article
of
his
law
this
great
statesman


provided

in
express
terms

that

the
wishes
of
families
should
always


be
consulted
and
complied
with
in
everything
affecting
the
religious


instruction
of
their
children


this
was
indeed
a
step
far
forward
in


the
path
of
true
liberalism

it
was
a
distinct
recognition
of
the
rights


of
the
family
as
against
the
encroachments
of
the
state

it
was
the



liberalism

not
of
the

ideologists

of


nor
of
the
third
republic


according
to
m

challemel
lacour

but
of
the
legislators
who
gave
lower


canada
her
equitable
system
of
common
and
of
dissident
schools

it
was


the
liberalism
of
those
courageous
men
who

like
montgaillard

bishop
of


st

pons

had
dared

under
louis
xiv


and
after
the
revocation
of
the


edict
of
nantes

to
protest
in

against
imposing
the
catholic


communion
by
force
upon
the
huguenot
ancestors
of
m

guizot






as
minister
of
public
instruction
under
louis
philippe
in


this


lover
of
true
liberty
simply
got
enacted
into
law
the
principles
which


had
led
him
as
a
brilliant
and
rising
young
man
of
letters
in

to


refuse
to
adulate
the
emperor

and
which
he
had
plainly
and
fearlessly


set
forth
as
the
necessary
conditions
of
the
constitutional
government


of
france
in
his
famous
interview
with
louis
xviii

three
years


afterwards






under
m

guizot
s
law
of


the
primary
schools
of
france
were
much


more
than
doubled
in
number
during
the
reign
of
louis
philippe






in
the
spirit
of
that
law
m

guizot
administered
the
affairs
of
france


during
his
long
tenure
of
official
authority

and
to
him

more
than
to


any
other
man

must
be
attributed
the
progress
which
france
made
under


louis
philippe
in
the
direction
of
liberty

as
englishmen
and
americans


understand
that
much
abused
word

that
progress
might
never
have
been


interrupted
had
the
counsels
of
m

guizot
prevailed
over
those
of
m



thiers
with
the
aged
monarch
who
trusted
the
one
but
yielded
to
the


other

in
february







now
that
a
parliamentary
oligarchy
has
deliberately
undertaken

in
the


name
of
the

moral
unity
of
france


to
undo
all
that
was
done
between



and

for
educational
liberty
in
france
and
to
protect
the
moral


independence
of
frenchmen

it
is
in
the
highest
degree
interesting
to


find
the
principles
of
m

guizot
energetically
maintained
by
the
heirs


of
his
blood
and
of
his
name

not
only
here
in
the
catholic
calvados


which
gave
the
great
protestant
statesman
so
staunch
a
support
through


all
his
years
of
power

and
surrounded
him
with
affection
and
respect


down
to
the
last
days
of
his
long
and
illustrious
life

but
in
southern


france
also

and
in
the
home
of
his
protestant
ancestors






val
richer
will
be
a
place
of
pilgrimage
for
lovers
of
liberty
in
the


twentieth
century

as
la
brede
is
in
the
nineteenth






but
the
genius
of
the
spot
is
more
purely
personal
in
the
home
of


guizot
than
in
the
birthplace
of
montesquieu






the
stately
rectangular
library
at
la
brede
with
its
thousands
of


soberly
clad
volumes

standing
as
he
left
them
on
its
shelves

annotated


by
his
own
hand

the
manuscripts
still
unfinished
of
the

lettres


persanes

the
grave
silent
cabinet

with
his
chair
beside
his


study
table

as
if
he
had
quitted
it
a
moment
before
you
came

all
these


are
eloquent

indeed

of
the
great
thinker
whose

esprit
des
lois


too


rich
in
ripe
wisdom
to
be
heeded
by
the
headlong
and
haphazard
political



plungers

of

in
his
own
country

illuminated
for
washington
the


problem
of
constituting
a
new
nationality
beyond
the
atlantic






but
la
brede
has
also
a
positive
physiognomy
of
its
own
which
takes
you


back
to
ages
long
before
his
birth

the
frowning
donjon
of
the


thirteenth
century

the
machicolated
round
tower

the
moat
with
its


running
water

the
drawbridge

the
vestibule
with
its
columns
of
twisted


oak

even
the
grand
salon
with
the
stately
courtiers
and
captains

the


gracious
dames
and
damsels
of
the
family
of
secondat
gazing
down
from


the
walls

all
these
distract
the
eye
and
the
mind

the
distraction
is


agreeable

but
still
it
is
a
distraction

it
leads
you
from
the


biographical
into
the
social
and
historical
mood

you
are
delighted
as


at
meillant
or
chenonceaux
with
a
corner
of
ancient
france

marvellously


rescued
from
the
red
ruin
of
the
revolution






val
richer

on
the
contrary

like
abbotsford

is
the
creation
of
the


master
whose
spirit
haunts
the
place

like
abbotsford

it
has
an
earlier


history
and
older
associations

but
of
these
there
are
few
or
no


material
signs

here
stood
the
great
abbey
of
which
thomas
a
becket
once


was
abbot

and
where
he
found
a
refuge
during
that
exile
from
which

in


his
own
words

he
went
back
to
england

to
play
a
game
in
which
the


stakes
were
heads


from
bures

near
bayeux

in
this
department

where


henry
was
then
holding
his
court

the
four
knights
followed
the
primate


to
canterbury

sternly
bent
on
showing
their
lord
that
they
were
neither



sluggish
nor
half
hearted


of
the
abbatial
buildings
which
stood
here


then
few
traces
are
left

but
the
handsome
modern
mansion
built
here
by


guizot
rests

i
believe

on
the
massive
foundations

and
certainly


incorporates
some
of
the
solid
masonry
above
ground
of
the
ancient


abbot
s
house

the
drive
to
val
richer
from
the
singularly
picturesque


old
norman
town
of
lisieux

within
whose
cathedral
walls
henry
of


england
was
married
to
eleanor
of
guienne

is
beautifully
shaded
all
the


way
with
noble
trees

and
bordered
on
either
hand
with
parks
and


gardens

no
english
county
can
show
a
more
strikingly
english


landscape

for
this
is
the
mother
country
of
norman
england

though
now


one
of
the
main
pillars
of
the
nationality
of
france

the
lady
chapel
of


the
cathedral
at
lisieux

indeed

was
founded
in
the
fifteenth
century


by
cauchon

bishop
of
beauvais

in
express
expiation
of
the

false


judgment
on
an
innocent
woman


by
which

as
he
lamentably
confessed
in


his
deed
of
gift

he
had
sent
the
deliverer
of
france
to
the
stake
at


rouen






the
park

like
the
mansion
of
val
richer

is
the
creation
of
m

guizot



the
monks
of
old
had
prepared
the
ground

for
here

as
everywhere

they


kept
alive
the
traditions
of
roman
landscape
art

the
parks
which
the


norman
nobles
made
on
both
sides
of
the
channel
were
mainly
devoted
to


the
chase

like
the

paradises

of
the
persians

but
the
monasteries


possessed
pleasure
grounds
and
gardens
of
all
sorts

the
beautifully


broken
and
undulating
surface
of
the
park
of
val
richer
attests

i


think

the
fashioning
hand
of
human
art
at
more
than
one
point

and
m



guizot

by
whom
most
of
the
fine
trees
which
now
adorn
the
place
were


planted

took
advantage

with
the
skill
of
a
professional
landscapist



of
all
the
opportunities
it
offered
him






i
can
well
believe

with
the
most
accomplished
and
appreciative
of
his


english
biographers

that
the
years
which
he
passed
here
after
his


return
from
the
exile
into
which
he
was
driven
by
the
unhappy


interference
of
m

thiers
at
the
most
critical
moment
of
the


disturbances
of
february


were
the
happiest
of
his
long
and


well
filled
life






the
halls
and
corridors
of
the
mansion
are
tapestried
with
books

the


green
secluded
alleys

the
gentle
knolls

the
glades

the
spacious


meadows
of
the
park

recall
at
every
step
the
younger
pliny
s


incomparable
picture
of
his
tuscan
villa



placida
omnia
et


quiescentia




a
spirit
of
pensive
peace
broods
over
the
whole
place



making
it
not
lovelier
only

but
more
salubrious

making
the
sky
more


pure

the
atmosphere
more
clear







people
who
imagine
convulsions
and
cataclysms
to
be
a
necessity
of


political
life
in
france

will
find
it
hard
to
explain
the
relations


which
existed
throughout
his
whole
career
from
the
time
when
he
took


part
in
forming
the
first
government
of
louis
philippe
to
the
day
of
his


death
between
this
great
protestant
statesman
and
the
catholics
of
the


calvados

these
relations
still
exist
between
his
representatives
at
val


richer
and
the
catholics
of
the
calvados






when
the
great
chancellor
de
l
hopital
was
using
all
his
influence
with


catherine
de

medici
to
prevent
the
outbreak
of
the
religious
wars
of


the
sixteenth
century

the
parisian
rabble
were
set
on
by
the
satellites


of
the
house
of
guise
to
attack
the
house
of
the
sieur
de
longjumeau
in


the
pre
aux
clercs

as
being
a
place
of
meeting
for
the
huguenots

the


sieur
de
longjumeau
had
no
respect
for
the

sacred
right
of


insurrection


and

getting
some
of
his
friends
into
his
house

gave
the


people
risen
in
their
majesty
such
a
thrashing
that
they
speedily


disbanded

upon
this
the

moral
unity

men
of
that
time
induced
the


court
to
banish
the
sieur
de
longjumeau
to
his
estates

on
the
ground


that

the
most
incompatible
thing
in
a
state
is
the
existence
of
two


forms
of
religion


this
is
the
doctrine
of
the
third
republic
to
day



france
cannot
live
with
a
mixed
population
of
believers
and
of


unbelievers

all
frenchmen
must
be
atheists

the
political
history
of


the
calvados
for
the
last
half
century

and
especially
of
this
region


about
lisieux
and
val
richer

meets
this

moral
unity

theory
with
a


practical
demonstration
of
its
absurdity

the
great
protestant
statesman


and
his
catholic
constituents
at
lisieux
lived
and
worked
together
for


liberty
and
for
law

not
in

moral
unity


but
in
moral
harmony

in


moral
harmony
his
protestant
son
in
law

m

conrad
de
witt

through
a


quarter
of
a
century
past
has
lived
and
worked
for
liberty
and
for
law


with
his
catholic
constituents
of
pont
l
eveque






the
catholics
of
the
calvados
are
not
such
intense
catholics
as
the


catholics
of
brittany
and
poitou

after
the
norman
rising
of



against
the
tyranny
at
paris
had
collapsed
so
dismally
in
the
ridiculous



battle

of
pacy

a
battle
which
began
with
the
flight
in
a
panic
from


the
field
of
the
vanquished
normans

and
ended
with
the
flight
in
a


panic
from
the
field
of
their
victorious
enemies
the
parisians

the


indignant
bretons
and
the
poitevins
marched
away
to
wage
that
contest


for
their
homes
and
their
altars
which
has
immortalized
the
name
of
la


vendee

the
less
impassioned
normans
made
terms
and
took
things
as
they


were

to
this
day
what
is
called
the

little
church

exists
in
brittany



made
up
of
peasants
who
regard
the
concordat
as
an
unworthy
compact
made


with
the
persecutors
and
the
plunderers
of
the
church
of
their
fathers






the
feeling
of
the
norman
catholics
after
pacy
and
the
miserable
failure


of
the
girondist
resistance
to
the
mountain
took
the
form
of
silent


disgust
with
the
republic
and
all
its
works

the
norman
heroine
in
whose


heart
this
silent
disgust
named
up
till
it
made
her
the
avenger
of


innocent
blood
upon
the
most
noisome
reptile
of
the
revolution

had


ceased
to
be
a
catholic
before
the
shame
of
her
country
moved
her
to
her


glorious
and
dreadful
deed

but
if
the
catholics
of
the
calvados
are


less
intense

they
are
not
less
sincere

than
the
catholics
of
brittany


or
poitou

it
is
no
indifference
in
matters
of
religion
which
makes
them


co
operate
so
cordially
with
their
protestant
friends
and


representatives

it
is
because
they
value
their
religion

and
mean
that


it
shall
be
respected

that
they
honour
the
memory
of
the
great
minister


who
held
sacred
and
inviolable
the
right
of
the
parent
to
be
heard
and


obeyed
in
the
matter
of
the
religious
education
of
his
children

the
two


daughters
of
m

guizot
married
two
brothers

the
heirs
of
one
of
the


most
illustrious
names
in
the
annals
of
european
liberty

one
of
these


brothers

now
lives
at
val
richer

and
administers


his
large
agricultural
property
lying
there
in
the
commune
of


st

ouen
le
pin

many
years
ago
he
won
the
gold
medal
of
the
french


society
of
agriculture

and
for
twenty
years
past
he
has
been
president


of
the
agricultural
society
of

in


under
the
empire



his
fellow
citizens
made
him
a
councillor
general
for
the
canton
of


cambremer

in
the
department
of
the
calvados

and
he
has
kept
his
seat


in
that
body
ever
since

until
he
last
year
declined
a
re
election

and


made
way
for
the
candidacy
of
his
nephew

m

pierre
de
witt

it
was
my


good
fortune
to
be
at
val
richer
when
the
election
came
off

the
canvass


had
been
carefully
pushed

for

although
the
republicans
ostentatiously


announced
their
intention
not
to
make
a
contest
in
which
they
were
sure


to
be
beaten

m

conrad
de
witt
and
his
nephew
are
not
men
to
take


anything
for
granted
where
serious
interests
are
concerned

there
were


symptoms

too

that
the
prefect
of
the
calvados

the
comte
de
brancion



a
newcomer

as
all
prefects
now
are
in
france

the
average
tenure
of
a


prefect
s
official
life
since

rarely
exceeding
eighteen
months


in
one
place


had
been
advised
from
paris
to
show
his
zeal
by


contriving
in
some
way
to
thwart

or
at
least
to
dampen

the
victory
of


the
nephew
in
july

as
a
preliminary
to
prevent
the
victory
of
the
uncle


in
september

for
m

conrad
de
witt
was
not
only
a
councillor
general
of


the
calvados

and
mayor
of
his
own
commune
of
st

ouen
le
pin

he
was


sent
to
the
chamber
of
deputies
in

as
a
monarchist
by
the
voters
of


the
calvados
by
a
majority
of


on
a
total
poll
of



and
when


he
declined
a
re
nomination
for
the
council
general

he
accepted
a


re
nomination
for
the
chamber






it
was
delightful
to
see
the
zealous
interest
taken
in
these
contests



not
only
by
the
family
at
val
richer

but
by
all
the
countryside

the


elections
for
the
councils
general
were
held
on
sunday

july






all
through
the
preceding
saturday
scouts
kept
coming
in
to
val
richer


with
the
latest
reports
as
to
the
state
of
things
in
the
various


communes
of
the
canton






the
tenor
of
these
was
uniform


there
would
be
no
contest

the
only


possible
republican
candidate

a
respectable
physician
who
had
some


local
strength
in
the
commune
in
which
he
lived

founded
upon
his
habit


of
gratuitously
attending
the
poor
of
that
commune

had
positively


declined
to
enter
the
field



all
the
same


said
one
energetic


volunteer
from
this
very
commune


we
don
t
mean
to
let
a
single
honest


voter
stay
at
home

we
understand
this
game

they
want
to
make
out
that


we
are
lukewarm
about
the
battle
that
is
to
come
off
in
september

that


won
t
go








furthermore


said
another
stalwart

keen
eyed

fresh
faced
young


farmer

who
might
have
passed
as
a
yorkshire
yeoman


furthermore

i


don
t
trust
this
republican
cock
till
he
s
dead

i
believe
he
s


shamming

but
he
shan
t
catch
us
asleep

this
prefect
at
caen
is
as
busy


as
the
evil
one

he
means
to
play
us
a
trick







the
shrewd
young
farmer
was
right

early

very
early

on
sunday
morning



long
before
daybreak

indeed

there
came
hastening
over
to
val
richer


from
the
commume
of
bonnebosq

some
miles
away

a
spirited
young
fellow



heart
and
soul
in
the
fight

with
the
news
that
a
story
was
putting


about
all
over
the
canton
that
m

pierre
de
witt
had
decided

at
the


last
moment

not
to
stand

and
that

on
the
strength
of
this
invention



the
nomination
of
dr






would
be
urged






the
polling
had
been
fixed
by
the
prefect
to
begin
in
all
the
communes


at

a
m


and
to
close
at

p
m

no
time
was

therefore

to
be
lost
in


getting
out
a
formal
contradiction
of
this
invention
of
the
enemy

and


the
vigorous
young
volunteer
from
bonnebosq
had
lost
no
time

he
roused


the
candidate

got
his
instructions

and

before
the
polls
were
opened



his
men
were
all
over
the
canton
at
work

in
the
course
of
the
day
i


drove
over
with
m

pierre
de
witt
to
bonnebosq

where
we
found
the


mother
of
this
energetic
young
politician

a
typical
norman
mother

full


of
sense
and
fire

quietly
proud
of
the
activity
and
intelligence
of
her


son

and
quite
as
much
in
the
day
s
work
as
he


not
a
pretty
trick




she
said


to
play
with
dr






he
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
it

and
i
am


sure
he
is


she
added

with
a
droll
twinkle
in
her
eye


for
it
has


turned
out
very
badly

he
will
just
be
beaten
like
plaster

it
would


have
been
cleverer
to
behave
like
a
decent
man


bonnebosq
had
a
very


lively

cheery
aspect
on
that
sunday
afternoon

it
is
a
busy
prosperous


little
place

with
about
a
thousand
inhabitants

the
village
church

a


new
and
very
handsome
french
ogival
building

most
creditable
to
the


architect

has
just
been
built
at
an
expense
of
several
hundred
thousand


francs
by
a
catholic
lady
of
the
canton

and
the
people
are
very
proud


of
it

it
struck
me
that
at
bonnebosq
the
outlook
for
a
moral
harmony


between
frenchmen
of
divers
religious
communions
contending
together
for


equal
rights
and
well
ordered
liberty
was
decidedly
better
than
the


outlook
for
a

moral
unity

of
france
to
be
promoted
by
the


authoritative
suppression
of
all
private
initiative
in
the
education
of


the
french
people

the
traditions
of
the
norman
race
do
not
tend
kindly


towards
a
system
under
which
the
individual
is
to
wither
that
the
state


may
be
more
and
more






as
mayor
of
the
commune
of
st

ouen
le
pin

m

conrad
de
witt
had
a
busy


day
of
it
on
sunday

july


the
holding
of
elections
on
sunday
is
a


tradition
in
france

two
elections
were
to
be
made

one
of
a


councillor
general
and
the
other
of
a
district
councillor

under
the


laws
of

and


these
elections
must
be
held
in
separate
though


adjoining
buildings
wherever
this
is
practicable

where
the
commune
is


too
small
to
furnish
these
facilities

the
two
elections
may
be
held
in


one
place

but
the
votes
for
the
two
officers
must
be
deposited
in
two


different
urns

these
urns
are
placed
upon
a
table

at
which
the
mayor


of
the
commune
presides
with
four
assessors
and
a
secretary

chosen
by


them
from
among
the
electors

as
the
electors
have
the
day
before
them



the
mayor
and
the
assessors
are
kept
close
prisoners
at
their
posts
till


the
polls
are
closed

nor
is
their
work
over
then

as
soon
as
the
clock


strikes

p
m

the
doors
of
the
bureau
close

but
the
mayor
and


the
assessors
must
then
proceed

immediately

to
examine
and
establish


the
results
of
the
voting

they
choose
from
among
the
electors
present
a


certain
number
of

scrutineers

knowing
how
to
read
and
write

these


scrutineers
take
their
seats
at
tables
prepared
for
the
purpose

at
each


table
there
must
be
at

the

while

if
there

than


there
were

this

votes

voted
for

or
on

which
bear

they


are

to
the

of

so


that

as

they
tell
against

moreover

if
there

the


excess
may
be
deducted
from
the

of

given
to

who
has
a

i
asked
a
very
bright
ruddy
farmer
in
a
spotless
blue
blouse

who
was


watching
the
elections
with
great
interest
in
one
of
the
communes

what


he
thought
of
this
provision


it
is
a
very
good
reason
for
watching
the


mayors


he
said



dame


a
clever
mayor
who
knows
his
commune

and
has


good
loose
sleeves
to
his
coat

can
slip
in
a
good
many
votes
in
this


way
against
the
candidate
who
he
knows
is
likely
to
win







i
told
him
that
in
my
own
country
we
guarded
the
palladium
of
our


liberties

a
queer
palladium
that
needs
to
be
guarded

against
this


peril
by
using
glass
globes
instead
of
the

urns

employed
in
france



which
are
in
fact
wooden
boxes

the
idea
delighted
him

he
rubbed
his


hands
together
with
a
chuckle

and
said

that
would
be
capital

that


would
bother
them

but
for
that
reason
we
shall
not
have
your
glass


urns







when
the
votes
have
all
been
emptied
out
of
the
urns
and
verified
and


counted
by
the
mayor
and
the
assessors

the
mayor
distributes
them
among


the
scrutineers

at
each
table
a
scrutineer
takes
the
votes
up
one
by


one

reads
out
in
a
clear
voice
the
name
of
the
candidate
inscribed
on


each
vote

and
passes
it
to
another
scrutineer

who
sees
it
duly


registered

the
mayor
and
assessors
the
while
supervising
all
the


proceeding

in
communes
containing
less
than

inhabitants
the
mayor


and
assessors
themselves
may
scrutinise
and
declare
the
results






as
st

falls
just
two
short
of
this
number

m

conrad
de


witt
not
only
lost
his
luncheon
but
his
dinner

he
never
got
back
to
the


chateau
till
ten
o
clock
at
night






the
polling
place
in
this
commune
was
a
small
house
opposite
the
village


church

i
walked
over
to
it
after
breakfast
through
the
fields
and
by


lovely
green
lanes
as
deep
as
the
lanes
of
devonshire

with
m

pierre
de


witt
and
one
of
his
kinsmen

the
mass
was
going
on
in
the
village


church

and
the
singing
of
the
choir
seemed
to
me
at
least
as
fitting
an


accompaniment
to
the
expression
by
the
sovereign
people
of
their


sovereign
will
through
bits
of
white
paper

mr

whittier
s

noiseless


snowflakes


as
the
braying
of
a
brass
band

or
the
hoarse
shouts
of
a


more
or
less
tipsy
multitude






in
the
protestant
corner
of
this
catholic
churchyard

under
some
fine


trees

m

guizot
sleeps
his
last
sleep
in
the
simple
tomb
of
his
family



here

again

i
thought

was
a
moral
harmony
better
than
any

moral


unity







we
had
a
merry
and
an
animated
dinner
that
night
at
val
richer

message


after
message
was
brought
in
from
the
nearest
communes

all
of
one


tenor

the
republican

trick

had
evidently
exasperated
the
worthy


norman
voters

and
brought
them
up
to
the
polls
most
effectually

by
ten


o
clock
it
was
clear
that
m

pierre
de
witt
was
elected
by
a
majority


too
large
to
be

whittled

away

and
that
the
surreptitious
appearance


of
the
republicans
in
the
field
had
served
only
to
emphasize
their


political
weakness

in
the
canton

cambremer
itself

lying
at
a
distance


of
eight
or
ten
kilometres

and
beuvron
only
remained
to
be
heard
from



it
was
possible
harm
might
have
been
done
there

for
a
law
passed
under


the
empire
in


and
undisturbed
for
obvious
reasons
by
the
third


republic

allows
the
prefect
of
a
department
to
determine
into
what


sections
he
will
divide
a
large
commune
for
the
purpose

according
to


the
law

of

bringing
the
electors
nearer
to
the
electoral
urn


this


opens
the
way

of
course

to
a
good
deal
of
what
in
america
would
be


known
as
official

gerrymandering


the
thing
may
be
of
any
country

the


name
we
owe
to
mr

elbridge
gerry

once
vice
president
of
the
united


states

who

when
his
party
controlled
massachusetts

devised
a
scheme


for
so
framing
the
electoral
districts
of
that
state
as
to
get
his


scattered
party
minorities
together

and
convert
them
thus
into


majorities

an
outline
map
of
the
state
thus
districted
was
declared
by


one
of
his
opponents
to

look
like
a
salamander



no

not
like
a


salamander


said
another


it
is
a
gerrymander







val
richer
was
full
of
little
fairies
in
that
bright
summer
weather

the


pied
piper
of
hamelin
must
have
passed
that
way

losing
some
stragglers


of
his
army
as
he
moved
along

wherever
you
strolled
in
the
park
you


came
unexpectedly
upon
little
blonde
heads
and
laughing
eyes
peering


through
the
shrubbery

and
saw
small
imps
scampering
madly
off
across


the
meadows

on
the
sunday
night
of
the
election

music
and
mirth
chased


the
hours
away

till

just
after
midnight

a
joyous
clamour
in
the
outer


hall
announced
some
event
of
importance

from
the
far
off
cambremer
and


beuvron
sur
auge
a
delegation
of
staunch
electors
had
arrived
to


announce
the
crowning
victory

thanks
to
the
distance
and
the



sections


the
votes
had
been
long
in
counting

but
they
had
been


counted

and
not
found
wanting

one
of
these
bringers
of
good
tidings


might
have
sat
or
stood
for
a
statue
of
william
the
conqueror
preparing


to
make
france
pay
dearly
for
the
jest
of
the
french
king
anent
his


colossal
bulk

he
was
a
man
in
the
prime
of
life

but
he
cannot
possibly


have
weighed
less
than

pounds

yet
he
moved
about
alertly

and
he


had
driven
over
in
a
light
wagon
at
full
speed

the
norman
horses
are


very
strong

to
congratulate
his
candidate
on
the
issue
of
a
fray
in


which
he
had
borne
his
own
part
most
manfully

m

pierre
de
witt
had


received


votes
as
councillor
general

against
no
more
than



given
to
his
medical
competitor






one
bold
voter
had
deposited
a
single
vote
for
general
boulanger


had


there
been
any
disturbances
anywhere


no

none
at
all


we
cheered
when


we
got
the
returns


said
the
giant


we
cheered
for
m

de
witt

and
we


cried

vive
le
roi


they
didn
t
like
it

but
they
were
so
badly
beaten



they
kept
quiet

i
believe
though


he
added


they
would
have
arrested


us
if
we
had
cried

vive
bocher


that
is
more
than
they
can
bear


and


therewith
he
laughed
aloud

a
not
unkindly

but
formidable
laugh






m

bocher

who
was
made
prefect
of
the
calvados
by
m

guizot

and
who
is


now
a
senator
for
that
department

is

i
am
assured

the
special

bete


noire

of
the
third
republic
in
normandy

his
long
and
honourable


connection
with
the
public
service
has
won
for
him
the
esteem
of
all
the


people
of
the
calvados

while
his
thorough
knowledge
of
the
political


history
of
the
country
and
of
his
time

his
cool
clear
judgment

his


temperate
but
fearless
assertion
through
good
and
evil
report
of
his


political
convictions

and
his
keen
insight
into
character

must
give


him
long
odds
in
any
contest
with
the
ill
trained
and
miserably
equipped


political
camp
followers
who
have
been
coming
of
late
years
into
the


front
of
the
republican
battle






they
gave
m

bocher
a
banquet
not
long
ago
at
pont
l
eveque

at
which
he


made
a
very
telling
speech

and
brought
down
the
house
by
inviting
his


hearers
to
contemplate
m

grevy
and
m

carnot
as
typical
illustrations


of
the
great
superiority
of
a
republic
over
a
monarchy

and
of
the


elective
over
the
hereditary
principle

the
republicans

he
said

had


twice
elected
to
the
chief
magistracy
an
austerely
virtuous
republican


whom
they
had
finally
been
compelled
to
throw
out
at
the
window
of
the


elysee

as

the
complaisant
and
guilty
witness

if
not
the
interested


accomplice

of
scandals
which
revolted
the
public
conscience


and
whom


had
the
elective
principle
put
into
his
place

under
the
pressure
of


irreconcilable
personal
rivalries

and
of
a
threatened
popular
outbreak



a
man
whose
recommendations
were
his
own
relative
personal
obscurity
and


the
traditional
reputation
of
his
grandfather






with
m

grevy
and
m

carnot
the
norman
farmers
have
a
special
quarrel


which
gave
zest
to
the
caustic
periods
of
m

bocher

the
all
powerful


son
in
law
of
m

grevy

m

wilson

proposed
in
the
national
assembly
in




and
with
the
influence
of
m

thiers

then
president

succeeded
in


passing
a
law
heavily
taxing

and
in
an
inquisitorial
fashion

the


domestic
fabrication
of
spirits

this
is
an
old
and
prosperous
industry


in
normandy

it
is
carried
on

according
to
an
official
estimate
made
in




by
above
five
hundred
thousand
farmers
in
france

and
in
normandy


particularly

a
land
of
apples
and
pears

it
is
a
great
resource
of
the


farmers

they
make
here
a
liquor
called
calvados

which
when
it
attains


a
certain
age
is
much
more
drinkable
and
much
less
unwholesome
than
most


of
the
casual
cognac
of
our
times

after
three
years
this
very
unpopular


law
was
repealed
in


mainly
through
the
efforts
of
m

bocher

it


had
plagued
the
farmers
more
than
it
benefited
the
treasury






the

bouilleurs
de
cru


as
these
domestic
distillers
are
called

had


made
during
the
three
years






hectolitres
of
spirits


which
paid
excise
duties

during
the
three
years


under
the


wilson
law
the
production
fell
to
about


hectolitres
a
year

in


the
first
year




after
the
repeal
of
the
law
it
rose
to




hectolitres






the
sale
of
crosses
of
the
legion

official
contracts
and
other


operations
not
consistent
with
that
virtue
on
which
alone
montesquieu


tells
us
a
republic
can
safely
repose

made
an
end
of
m

wilson
and
of


his
father
in
law

but
the
enormous
republican
deficit
kept
on


increasing

and
in


under
the
presidency
of
m

carnot

the


republicans
revived
a
project
formed
by
m

carnot
when
minister
of


finance

in


for
imposing
upon
the

bouilleurs
de
cru

anew
the


severe
and
inquisitorial
taxation
of


under
the
law
introduced
to


effect
this

january




the
whole
of
the
buildings
in
which
any


part
of
the
processes
of
this
production
may
be
carried
on
must
be
open


to
the
tax
officers

at
all
hours
of
the
day
or
night


as
many
of
the



bouilleurs
de
cru

are
small
farmers
who
use
part
of
their
houses
for


some
of
these
processes

it
may
be
imagined
how
bitterly
they
oppose


such
a
law

they
have
no
more
love
for
tax
gatherers
than
the
people
of


other
countries
have

but
the
english
maxim
that
every
man
s
house
is


his
castle
is
a
distinctly
norman
maxim

and
this
menace
offered
to
the


sanctity
and
privacy
of
the
domicile
has
profoundly
exasperated
the


norman
populations

it
is
of
a
piece

they
think

with
the
arbitrary


school
system
and
with
the
elaborate
contrivances
devised
to
deprive
the


communes
of
the
right
finally
to
certify
and
give
effect
to
the
returns


of
their
own
elections

above
all

it
is
an
interference
with
an
ancient


and
customary
right


what
business
have
these
lawyers
and
doctors
at


paris


said
a
farmer
here
to
me


to
be
meddling
with
our
usages
and


ways
here
on
our
lands
in
normandy

let
them
fix
general
taxes

and


leave
us
to
pay
them
in
our
own
way







the
war
against
the
church
affects
these
normans
in
the
same
way

it


does
not
seem
to
rouse
them
into
a
kind
of
fanatical
fervour

such
as


blazes
up
here
and
there
in
other
parts
of
france

but
it
angers
them
as


a
disturbance
of
their
settled
habits
and
convictions


the
church




said
one
of
these
calvados
farmers
to
m

de
witt


the
church
is
the
key


of
our
trade

they
must
not
touch
it







what
he
meant
was

that
on
sunday
at
the
village
church
the
farmers



after
the
mass

are
in
the
habit
of
talking
over
all
their
affairs


together

it
is
a
kind
of
social
exchange
for
men
whose
calling
in
life


keeps
them
far
apart
during
the
week






is
it
to
be
supplanted
for
the
benefit
of
the
france
of
the
future
by


cockpits
and
cabarets

or
courses
of
lectures
delivered
in

scholastic


palaces


by
spectacled
and
decorated
professors

on
the

struggle
for


life


and
the

survival
of
the
fittest







the
victory
of
m

pierre
de
witt
in
july
was
too
complete
to
leave
any


pretext
for
meddling
with
its
results
of
which
the
authorities
liked
to


avail
themselves

the
law

however

gives
abundant
opportunities
for


such
meddling
wherever
a
plausible
pretext
can
be
found

after
the
votes


of
a
commune
have
been
verified
and
counted

two
of
the
assessors
start


off
at
once
with
all
the
votes
and
papers
for
the
chief
town
of
the


canton

the
bureau
of
this
chief
town
has
power
to

verify
and

if
need


be

remake
the
calculations
which
show
the
majority

it
may
modify
the


decisions
of
the
communal
bureaux
as
to
the
candidate
to
whom
certain


votes
properly
belong

may
decide
what
votes
are
to
be
treated
as


entirely
null

or
to
be
counted
in
estimating
the
majority
without
being


held
as
given
to
either
candidate

it
may
also
decide
what
votes
belong


to
a
candidate

it
may
also
take
away
from
the
candidates
elected

or


claiming
to
have
been
elected

all
votes
found
in
the
urn
or
urns
in


excess
of
the
number
of
electors
actually
tallied
as
voting







the
decisions
reached
by
the
bureau
are
next
to
be
collated
with
the



proces
verbaux

of
the
communal
bureaux

after
which
all
the
documents


connected
with
the
election

including
the
tally
lists
of
the
voters



are
to
be
sent
to
the
prefect
of
the
department






when
the
legislative
elections
came
on
in
september
the
authorities
of


the
calvados
made
desperate
efforts
to
break
the
solid
front
of
the


monarchist
deputation
from
this
department

in
the
arrondissement
of


pont
l
eveque

where
m

conrad
de
witt
stood
as
the
monarchist


candidate

the
official
interference
against
him
was
so
open
that
the


prefect

m

de
brancion

did
not
hesitate
to
sign
and
circulate
a
letter


intended
to
affect
the
elections

though
by
article

of
the
law
of


november




regulating
elections

all
agents
of
the
government


are
expressly
forbidden
to
distribute
ballots

professions
of
faith

or


circulars
affecting
the
candidates

m

de
witt
had
cited
to
the
electors


a
remarkable
declaration
made
in
the
senate
by
m

leon
say
as
to
the


inevitable
increase
of
local
taxation
which
must
be
expected
from
the


development
and
enforcement
of
the
government
policy
in
regard
to


education






m

leon
say
resigned
his
seat
in
the
senate
last
year
that
he
might


enter
the
chamber

his
friends
having
convinced
themselves

on
no
very


apparent
grounds

that
his
appearance
in
the
chamber
would
rally
around


him
the
support
of
conservative
men
of
all
shades
of
opinion

and
make


him
master
of
the
situation

he
was
a
candidate
in
the
hautes
pyrenees



the
quotation
made
by
m

de
witt
from
his
sensible
speech
in
the
senate


much
disturbed
the
republicans
in
the
calvados

and
some
official


application
was
evidently
made
to
him
on
the
subject

for

without


denying
that
he
had
said
in
the
senate
what
was
imputed
to
him

he
seems


to
have
assured
the
republicans
of
the
calvados
that
it
was
absurd
to


suppose
he
would
so
speak
of
the
government
policy
when
he
was
standing


as
a
government
candidate
for
election
to
the
chamber

this
obvious
but


quite
irrelevant
statement
was
instantly
circulated
all
over
the


department
by
the
prefect
himself

as
it
was
very
easily
disposed
of

it


did
no
great
harm

but
it
is
a
curious
illustration
of
the
way
in
which


these
election
matters
are
managed
now
in
france

m

de
witt
was


triumphantly
re
elected

receiving


votes
against


in
the


arrondissement
of
pont
l
eveque

the
monarchists
also
carried
every


other
seat
for
the
calvados

making
seven
in
all






in


under
the

scrutin
de
liste


the
votes
given
to
m

de
witt


show
a
conservative
majority
in
the
calvados
of


in
a
total
poll


of



in


taking
all
the
districts
together

the
calvados


showed
a
monarchist
majority
of


in
a
total
poll
of



this


gives
us
a
falling
off
in
the
total
poll
of



and
an
increase
in


the
monarchist
majority
of


votes






i
called
m

conrad
de
witt
s
attention

after
the
legislative
elections


were
over

to
an
article
in
an
english
periodical
by
a
french
protestant


writer

m

monod

in
which
the
monarchist
majority
of

in
the


calvados
was
attributed
to
the
bad
harvest
of
pears
and
apples

the


veteran
protestant
president
of
the
society
of
agriculture
in
the


calvados
smiled
in
a
quiet
and
significant
way

and
simply
said


ah

i


think
we
are
more
solid
than
that







so
indeed
it
would
seem






the

apple
blight

of
the
calvados
must
obviously
have
extended
into
the


neighbouring
department
of
the
eure

or
at
least
into
the
great
and
busy


arrondissement
of
bernay

which
gave
the
monarchist
candidate
in


september

the
tremendous
majority
of


votes
in
a
total
poll
of





possibly

too

there
may
be
some
occult
relation
between
this


remarkable
result
and
the
presence
in
this
arrondissement
of
one
of
the


most
distinguished
of
living
frenchmen

and
one
of
the
most
outspoken


champions
of
the
constitutional
monarchy

an
able
man
with
a
mind
of
his


own

and
the
courage
to
speak
it

is
a
force
in
any
country
at
any
time



in
france
at
this
time
such
a
man
is
a
determining
force

the
obvious


weakness
of
the
monarchical
party
in
france
was
touched
by
the


committee
of
the
catholic
association
in
their
report
to
which
i
have


alluded
in
another
chapter

it
is
the
association
in
the
popular
mind
of


the
monarchical
idea
with
the
traditions
of
versailles
and
with
the



pomps
and
vanities

of
what
is
ridiculously
called


le
high
life


of


modern
paris

as
a
matter
of
fact

all
that
was
silliest
and
most


scandalous
in
the
court
life
of
france
in
the
eighteenth
century
was


reproduced
and
exaggerated
under
the
directory

what
is
there
to
choose


between
louis
xv

doffing
his
hat
beside
the
coach
of
madame
du
barry



and
barras
ordering
ouvrard
to
keep
madame
tallien
in
diamonds



opera
boxes

coaches
and
villas

out
of
the
profits
of
public
loans
and


contracts
for
the
service
of
the

republic
one
and
indivisible


formula


for
formula

to
speak
after
the
manner
of
mr

carlyle


is
not
the


republican
formula
of
the
two
the
more
demoralizing

dismal

degraded



and
altogether
hopeless

what
is
called


le
high
life


of
paris
is


neither
royalist
nor
republican

it
is
merely
shallow
and
vulgar

like


the


high
life


of
sundry
other
places
ruled
by
governments
of
divers


forms

but
when
young
men
born
to
names
which
in
the
popular
mind


represent
the
history
of
france
show
themselves
as
athletes
in
a


parisian
circus

or
appear
as
grooms
on
the
carriages
of

cocottes

in


the
bois
de
boulogne

their
folly
naturally
damages
more
or
less
in
the


public
estimation
the
principles
with
which
the
names
they
bear
are


associated






under
the
empire
the
legitimists

as
a
body

really
played
the
game
of


the
emperor
by
holding
themselves
aloof
from
public
life
in
all
its


departments

in
accordance
with
the
policy
adopted
by
the
comte
de


chambord

the
inevitable
effect
of
this
policy
was
to
widen
the
gulf


between
them
and
the
body
of
the
french
people

it
tended
to
bring
about


in
france
results
like
those
aimed
at
by
the
national
league
in


ireland

and
to
prevent
a
gradual
and
wholesome
reconciliation
between


the
heirs
of
the
class
which
was
exiled
and
plundered
during
the


revolution

and
the
heirs
of
the
classes
which
eventually
profited
by


the
proscriptions
and
confiscations
of
that
unhappy
time

the
disastrous


war
of


did
much
to
counteract
the
social
mischief
thus
wrought



the
french
legitimists
came
forward
in
all
parts
of
france
to
the


defence
of
their
country

they
were
brought
thus
into
contact
with
the


people
and
the
people
with
them

they
ceased
to
be
a
caste
and
began
to


be
citizens

the
way
was
thus
prepared

too

for
that
fusion
of
the
two


great
royalist
camps

the
camp
of
the
legitimists
and
the
camp
of
the


orleanists

which
has
since
taken
place

a
very
intelligent
young


officer
of
engineers

himself
the
heir
of
an
ancient
name

told
me
at


dijon
that
there
are
at
this
time
more
men
of
the
old
families
of
france


on
the
rolls
of
the
army
than
ever
before
since


instead
of


rejoicing
in
this
as
the
wholesome
sign
of
a
growing
moral
harmony


between
all
classes
of
frenchmen

the
leaders
of
the
republican
party


have
been
incensed
by
it

doubtless
they
regard
it
as
an
obstacle
to
the


development
of
their
idea
of

moral
unity


under
president
grevy

the


minister
of
war
actually
drove
one
of
the
best
soldiers
in
france



general
schmidt

out
of
his
command
at
tours
by
insisting
that
he
should


forbid
his
officers
to
accept
invitations
from
their
friends
who
lived


in
the
chateaux
which
are
the
glory
of
touraine

the
traditional
garden


of
france

imagine
a
high
church
secretary
at
war
in
england
issuing
an


order
that
no
officer
in
a
garrison
corps
should
dine
with
a
catholic
or


a
dissenter






this
was
not
a
freak

it
was
a
policy

it
was
in
perfect
keeping
with
an


amazing
attack
made
by
the
republican
press
of
paris
not
long


afterwards
upon
the
then
american
minister
in
france

mr

morton

now


vice
president
of
the
united
states

for
giving
a
dinner
in
honour
of


the
comte
de
paris

the
comte
de
paris
and
his
brother

the
duc
de


chartres

had
served
with
distinction
on
the
staff
of
the


commander
in
chief
of
the
union
armies
in
america

they
were
the
sons
of


a
french
sovereign

with
whose
government
the
government
of
the
united


states
had
long
held
close
and
friendly
relations

the
comte
de
paris
is


the
author
of
the
most
careful

thorough

and
impartial
history
yet


written
of
the
american
civil
war
of



yet

for
showing
his


personal
and
official
respect
for
a
french
prince
possessing
such
claims


upon
the
respect
of
frenchmen
as
well
as
of
americans

the
diplomatic


representative
of
the
united
states
was
assailed
with
coarse
and
vulgar


violence
in
the
columns
of
journals
assuming
to
represent
the


civilization
of
the
capital
of
france






some
time
after
the
incident
to
which
i
have
referred
at
tours
occurred



i
drove
from
st

malo
to
la
basse
motte

the
charming
and
picturesque


house
of
general
de
charette

in
the
ille
et
vilaine

with
the
marquis


de
la
roche
jaquelein

the
autumn
manoeuvres
of
the
french
army
were


then
going
on

on
the
way
he
told
me
among
other
things
that
the


officers
of
a
cavalry
brigade
encamped
for
two
or
three
days
in
the


neighbourhood
of
his
chateau
had
been
forbidden
by
their
brigade


commander
to
accept
a
dinner
to
which
he
had
invited

not
only
them

but


their
commander
also

the
general
in
command
of
the
cavalry
division


fortunately
happened
to
arrive
before
the
day
fixed
for
the
dinner

and



having
been
informed
of
this
state
of
affairs

quietly
authorized
the


officers
to
attend
the
dinner

and
attended
it
himself






can
anything
be
more
absurd
than
to
attempt
to
naturalize
a
republic
in


france
by
identifying
republican
institutions
with
such
tyrannical


interference
as
this
in
the
private
and
social
relations
of
french


officers
and
citizens






the
third
republic
has
improved
upon
cambon
s
piratical
watchword




guerre
aux
chateaux

paix
aux
chaumieres


it
makes
war
socially
upon


the

chateaux


and
it
makes
war
religiously
and
financially
upon
the



chaumieres







all
this
must
bring
out
into
clearer
relief
before
the
french
people
the


unquestionable
personal
superiority
of
the
monarchist
over
the


republican
leaders
and
representatives

it
is
undeniable
that
an


overwhelming
majority
of
the
ablest
and
most
influential
men
in
france



of
all
classes
and
conditions

are
to
day
in
open
opposition
either
to


the
policy
or
to
the
constitution
of
the
existing
republic

or
to
both



many

i
think
most
of
them

are
agreed
that
the
monarchy
must
be


restored
if
france
is
to
be
saved
from
anarchy
and
dismemberment

the


rest
of
them
are
agreed
that
the
republic
must
be
so
remodelled
as
to


become
in
fact

if
not
in
name

a
monarchy

in
this
condition
of
the


country

the
avowed
monarchists
must
inevitably
draw
to
themselves
the


support
of
all
who
differ
from
them

not
as
to
the
end

but
as
to
the


means
only

for
the
logic
of
events
is
steadily
strengthening
the


verdict
uttered
by
the
duc
de
broglie
three
years
ago
on
the
republican


experiments

in
a
speech
made
by
him
before
the
monarchist
union
at


paris
on
may





all
these
political
ghosts
must
go
flitting
by



but
france
will
endure
and
remain

forced
to
pay
the
price
of
their


follies
in
the
form
of
interest
on
their
loans







there
is
no
war
now
between
the
chateau
de
broglie
and
the
cottages
of


the
eure

certainly
no
war
between
the
chateau
and
the
town
of
broglie



the
town
is
bright

pretty
and
prosperous

the
park
gates
open
into
it


as
the
park
gates
of
arundel
castle
open
into
arundel

but
without
even


the
semblance
of
a
fortification






the
park
is
very
extensive
and
nobly
planned

with
a
certain
stateliness


rather
italian
than
english

the
ground
undulates
beautifully

and
from


its
great
elevation
above
the
river
and
the
town
commands
in
all


directions
the
most
charming
views

the
roads
and
walks
are
admirably


laid
out

the
trees
well
grown
and
lofty

the
chateau
itself
dates
back



as
to
its
earlier
portions

to
the
hundred
years

war

it
was
more
than


once
besieged
by
the
english

and
some
of
the
ivy
grown
walls
and
towers


which
overlook
the
town
take
you
back
to
edward
iii

and
the
black


prince

but
the
long
facade
and
the
main
buildings
are
of
the


seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries

during
which
the
de
broglies
made


so
much
french
history

within

the
spacious
saloons

the
grand


vestibule
and
hall

and
the
delightful
library
are
in
perfect
keeping


with
the
traditions
of
a
family
which
for
generations
has
given
soldiers


and
statesmen
to
the
service
of
a
great
people

of
course
the
chateau


has
been
much
restored
during
the
present
century

but
its
general


disposition
is
what
it
was
in


and

like
that
of
all
the
french


chateaux
of
the
eighteenth
century

it
attests
the
friendly
relations


which
must
have
existed
before
the
revolution
between
the

chateau

and


the

chaumiere


the
english
mansions
even
of
the
time
of
queen
anne
are


more
defensible
than
these

chateaux


the
windows

of
the
sort
which
to


this
day
are
called
french
windows
in
england
and
america

are
long


windows
opening
like
doors

on
the
ground
floor
they
come
down

indeed



nearly
to
the
level
of
the
lawn

it
is
perfectly
obvious
that
no
thought


of
a
war
of
classes
can
have
entered
the
minds
of
the
architects
who


planned
these
edifices
or
of
the
owners
for
whom
they
were
planned

yet


the
problems
of
government
which
we
imagine
to
be
of
our
own
times
had


been
hotly
discussed
and
were
hotly
discussing
when
these
edifices
were


built

the
ideas

not
of
villegardelle
only

but
of
proudhon

were
put


forth
in
germ
by
de
la
jonchere
in


in
his

plan
of
a
new


government


the
chateau
de
broglie
resembles
a
feudal
castle
of
the


fourteenth
or
even
of
the
sixteenth
century
no
more
than
it
resembles
a


roman
villa
of
the
first
century

the
magnificent
liberality
with
which


the
vicomte
de
noailles

himself
a
younger
son

gave
away
all
the
feudal


rights
and
privileges
of
the

noblesse

on
the
night
of
august






has
always

i
am
sorry
to
say

reminded
me
irresistibly
of
the
patriotic


ardour
with
which
mr

artemus
ward
devoted
to
the
battle
field
of


freedom
the
remotest
cousins
of
his
wife

the
evidence
is
overwhelming


which
goes
to
show
that
these
feudal
rights
and
privileges
were


practically
no
more
oppressive
in
the
france
of

than
they
were
in


the
england
of


it
is
not
even
clear
that
the
new
york
anti
renters


of
our
time
had
not
as
good
a
case
for
ridding
themselves
of

feudal



rights
and
privileges
by
storming
the
capitol
at
albany
as
the
people
of


france
for
ridding
themselves
of
those
rights
and
privileges
by
storming


the
practically
defenceless
bastille

the
bastille
interfered
no
more


with
the
liberty
of
paris
in

than
the
tower
with
the
liberty
of


london

the
only
people
in
any
particular
peril
of
it
were
the

black


sheep

of
the

noblesse


as
to
whom
even
jefferson

in
the
sketch
of
a


charter
of
french
rights
which
he
drew
up
in
june

and
sent
to


lafayette
and
the
bookseller
st

etienne

proposed
that
their
personal


liberty
should
be
subject
to
a
special
kind
of
imprisonment
at
the


prayer
of
their
relations

or
in
other
words
to
a
regular

lettre
de


cachet







it
is
a
curious
illustration

by
the
way

of
the
incapacity
of
this


national
assembly
that
in
july

its
committee
for
framing
a


constitution
actually
invited
a
foreign
envoy

jefferson

to
take
part


with
them
in
their
work

jefferson
had
sense
enough
to
decline
the


invitation

but
what
gleam
of
sense

political
or
other

had
the


blundering
tinkers
who
gave
it

the
outcome
of
their
gabble
was
that
mob


violence
destroyed
for
paris
in
the
bastille
what
london
possesses
in


the
tower

an

architectural
document

of
the
highest
authenticity
and


importance

to
talk
of
french
feudalism
as
having
been
overthrown
by


such
men
is
absurd

if
it
had
existed
when
they
met

it
would
have
very


soon
sent
them
about
their
business

but
it
did
not
exist
when
they
met



the
author
of
the
curious

precis
d
une
histoire
generale
de
la
vie


privee
des
francais


published
in


treats
the
whole
subject
of
the


private
life

homes

manners

and
fortunes
of
the
french
people


expressly
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
great
change
which
had
come
over


them


since
the
abolition
of
feudalism


the
magnanimous
achievement
of


the
vicomte
de
noailles
ought
to
rank
in
history
with
the
victory
of
don


quixote
over
the
wine
skins

or
with
the
revolutionary
feat
of
that


drum
major
of
the
national
guard
who
slashed
with
his
sabre
the
corpse


of
the
unfortunate
procureur
syndic
bayeux

lying
battered
to
death
in


the
place
des
tribunaux
at
caen

on
september




and
whom
the


honest
normans
of
the
calvados
afterwards
kicked
out
of
the
city
as

fit


only
for
killing
dead
men







even
in
the
chateaux
of
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
and
the


beginning
of
the
seventeenth
we
get
unanswerable
architectural
evidence


to
show
a
steady
improvement
in
the
social
relations
of
the
people
with


the
noblesse

the
chateau
d
eu

for
example

in
the
seine
inferieure

in


which
louis
philippe
entertained
prince
albert
and
queen
victoria

and


from
which
the
comte
de
paris
and
his
family
were
so
lawlessly
expelled


in


was
a
true
fortress
in
the
days
when
the
norman
princes
and


their
armies
went
and
came
between
england
and
france

and
treport
saw


many
an
armada

in

confirming
to

the
immunity
of

binding
himself
not

for
good

when
the
great
duke
of
guise
rebuilt
the
chateau
of
brick
in
the


sixteenth
century

he
put
down
most
of
the
outer
fortifications

without


these
the
chateau
is
as
much
a
part
of
the
town
of
eu
as
buckingham

is
of
st

catherine
of
cleves

the
widow
of
the


great
duke
of
guise

lived
at
eu
through
her
long
widowhood
in
the


friendliest
relations
with
the
good
people
of
the
town

while
the


architects
were
erecting
for
herself
and
her
murdered
husband


the


nonpareil
of
the
world


as
she
called
him

notwithstanding
his


admiration
of
mme

de

the
beautiful
monuments
which
still


adorn
the
collegiate
church

her
daughter

the
lovely
and
lively


princesse
de
conti

gathered
a
gay
and
gallant
company
of
friends
about


her

and
lived
an
open
air
life
of
hunting

promenades

and
after
dinner



games
of
wit


upon
the
terraces

as
unconcernedly
at
the
end
of
the


sixteenth
century

i
was
about
to
say

as
such
a
life
could
be
lived


here
now

but
i
have
to
remember
that
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth


century

and
under
the
illumination
of
the

ideas
of



the
tomb
of


this
princess
in
the
chapel
of
ste
catherine
was
broken
into

and
her


bones
flung
about
on
the
floor
of
the
mortuary
vault

while
at
the
end


of
this
nineteenth
century
the
legitimate
owners
of
the
chateau
which


has
replaced
the
home
of
louise
de
lorraine
et
de
conti
have
been
driven


into
exile
for
no
other
crime
but
that
of
their
birth
by
a
government


which
professes
to
be
a
government
of
liberty

equality

and
fraternity






in
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
chateau
d
eu

with
the


whole
domain

was
sold
on
behalf
of
the
duc
de
joyeuse
et
d
angouleme



the
ruined
heir
of
the
guises

to

la
grande
mademoiselle


the
restless


and
ambitious
daughter
of
gaston
d
orleans

brother
of
louis
xiv

her


relations
with
the
people
of
eu
were
more
than
cordial

history
concerns


itself
with
her
as
the
bellona
of
the
fronde

and
court
chronicles
as


the
wife
of
that
eminent
scamp
lauzun

but
at
eu
she
was
the
providence


of
the
poor
and
the
helpless

she
founded
hospitals
and
charities
of
all


sorts

the
endowments
of
most
of
these
were
calmly
confiscated
during


the
revolution

one
hospital

so
well
endowed
that

in
spite
of
the



assignats

and
of
dilapidation

it
still
had
a
revenue
of




francs

was
suppressed
in


and
the
building
turned
into
a
barrack



despite
the
remonstrances
of
a
worthy
mayor
who
still
lives
in
the
local


traditions
of
eu

this
functionary
confronted
napoleon
more
creditably


than
the
mayor
of
folkestone
confronted
queen
elizabeth

he
received
the


emperor
and
began
his
harangue

presently
he
stammered

hesitated

and


broke
down


what


said
napoleon


mr

mayor

a
man
like
you



ah



sire


responded
the
quick
witted
magistrate


in
the
presence
of
a
man


like
your
majesty

cease
to
be
a
man
like
myself


another
of
the


foundations
of
the

exists
in
the
chief


hospital
of

now
become
the
property
of
the
town

the
treasurer
and


the
physician
of
this
hospital

both
of
them
citizens
of
the
highest


character

who
have
filled
their
respective
posts
for
years

are


outspoken
royalists

at
the
elections
of
last
year
they
voted
as
usual


with
their
own
party

when
the
elections
were
over

the
prefect
of
the


seine
inferieure
requested
the
municipal
council
of
eu
to
remove
both
of


them

this
the
councillors

though
republicans

declined
to
do



whereupon
the
prefect
removed
them
by
a
decree
of
his
own






the
chateau
d
eu
came
into
the
possession
of
louis
philippe
through
his


mother

who
was
the
daughter
of
the
duc
de
penthievre

and
of
whose


admirable
character
and
exemplary
patience
with
her
impossible
husband


philippe
egalite

gouverneur
morris
paints
so
lively
a
picture

the
duke


was
so
much
beloved
at
eu

where
he
habitually
lived

that
no
personal


harm
came
to
him
during
the
first
years
of
the
revolution

he
died
at


vernon

on
the
eve
of
the
terror

and
so
was
spared
the
pain
of


witnessing
the
excesses
perpetrated
at
eu
as
elsewhere

not
only
during


that
period
but
under
the
directory

an
accomplished
resident
of
eu


showed
me
a
decree
of
the
directory

issued
in


and
ordering
the


people
to
meet
on
january



the
anniversary
of
the
just
punishment
of


the
last
french
king

and
swear
hatred
to
the
monarchy



what
has
come


of
all
that
fury
and
folly


he
said


for
years
since
then
the
people


of
eu
have
not
only

sworn


but
shown

genuine
affection
and
respect
to


two
french
kings

louis
xviii

and
louis
philippe

they
didn
t
care
much


about
charles
x


but
they
were
contented
under
his
reign

eu
owes
the


restoration
of
our
noble
churches
and
monuments
to
these
kings

and
to


their
representative
the
comte
de
paris

one
of
these
kings
brought
the


sovereign
of
england
and
her
husband
to
visit
eu

and
made
us
feel
in


our
little
norman
town
that
the
great
days
of
normandy
were
not
over

of


that
fine
collection
of
pictures
and
of
portraits
you
have
been
admiring


in
the
chateau

a
great
proportion
belonged
to
the
duc
de
penthievre



and
these

with
many
other
valuable
things
in
the
chateau

were
quietly


taken
out
and
saved
when
the
robberies
and
blasphemies
began
here

by


the
mayor
of
eu
of
that
day

who
risked
his
life
by
doing
that
good


deed

when
the
comte
and
the
comtesse
de
paris
lived
here

the
park
and


the
gardens
were
the
pride
and
pleasure
of
the
people

those
fountains


are
fed
by
water
which
the
comte
de
paris
had
brought
to
eu
for
the


service
of
the
town

and
the
town
is
served
by
it
now

every
year
eu
was


filled
with
people
who
came
and
lived
here
because
the
comte
and
the


comtesse
de
paris
were
here

what
good
has
their
exile
done
to
eu

here


in
eu
we
know
them

it
is
not
they
who
are
responsible
for
the
local


debt
of
eu

of
which
we
who
have
to
pay
it
can
get
no
account
at
all


from
our
precious
authorities

except
in
the
form
of
a
demand
for
more


taxes







as
to
the
last
century

you
are
quite
right

here

in
this
part
of


normandy

there
were
no
such
grievances
then
as
we
have
now

there
were


troubles
with
bad
roads
and
bad
agriculture

there
were
quarrels
about


this
right
and
that
privilege

the
cures
didn
t
like
the
grand
airs
of


the
church
dignitaries

the
squires


hobereaux


were
conceited
very


often
and
ignorant
and
arrogant

we
have
not
got
rid
of
conceit
and


ignorance
and
arrogance

though

by
cutting
off
the
heads
of
a
few


squires
a
hundred
years
ago

no

as
to
eu

at
least

take
my
word
for


it

the
happiest
day
we
can
see
will
be
the
day
when
we
can
welcome
back


here
the
prince
and
the
princess
who
lived
so
pleasantly
and
so
usefully


with
us
and
among
us

as
king
and
queen
of
the
french

we
are
royalists


here
because
we
know
the
comte
de
paris

and
know
that
he
would
do
his


duty
as
the
king
of
a
free
people

and
be
something
better
than
the
tool


of
a
swarm
of
needy
and
self
seeking
adventurers

there
is
a
strong


feeling
here

too

about
the
intolerant
interference
of
those
atheists


at
paris
with
the
rights
of
parents
and
with
freedom
of
conscience

yet


we
are
not
in
the
least
a
priest
ridden
people

on
the
contrary

i
can


show
you
a
commune
where
the
people

vexed
with
the
charges
of
their


cure

have
deliberately
organized
a
protestant
chapel

they
sent
to
the


consistory
at
paris

and
got
a
minister

and
they
are
doing
very
well



what
we
want
here
is
private
liberty
and
public
economy

the
republic


gives
us
neither

the
monarchy

we
believe

will
give
us
both

owe
the
best
delineation

possess

and
of
whom
mr



bancroft

the
historian
of
the
american
constitution

bears
witness


that

as
premier
of

he
unreservedly
threw
open
to
his
researches


all
the
archives
of
france
in
any
way
bearing
upon
the
history
of
the


united

nothing
was
refused
me
for
examination

says


nor


was
one
line
of
which
i
desired
a
copy
withheld







broglie
was
the
birthplace
of
another
french
soldier
who
learned
in


america
to
venerate
the
character
of
washington

and
whose
life
paid
the


forfeit
under
the
first
despotic
french
republic
of
his
loyalty
to


liberty
and
the
law

victor
charles
de
broglie
was
a
son
of
the
veteran


marshal
of
france


cool
and
capable
of
anything


whom
mr

carlyle


perorates
about
as
the

war
god


as
the
chief
of
staff
of
biron

in
the


army
of
the
rhine

he
refused
to
recognise
the
usurpers
of
august






in
a
letter
to
his
commander
which
is
a
model
of
common
sense
and


military
honour

upon
this
letter
carnot

then
a
legislative


commissioner

or

in
plain
english

inspector
and
informer
of
the


convention

on
duty
with
the
army

made
a
report
far
from
creditable


either
to
his
head
or
his
heart

victor
charles
de
broglie
was


eventually
guillotined

taking
farewell
of
his
son

a
child
nine
years


old

he
bade
him

never
allow
himself
to
believe
that
it
was
liberty


which
had
taken
his
father
s
life


the
child
grew
to
manhood
and
to


fame

for
ever
mindful
of
this
brave
injunction

he
was
the
minister
of


louis
philippe
when
the
claims
arising
out
of
the
lawless
depredations


of
the
first
republic
and
the
empire
upon
american
commerce
were
finally


recognised
and
settled
by
france

and
mr

bancroft
pays
him
a
high
and


well
deserved
tribute
for
the
courage
with
which
he
insisted
on
keeping


faith
with
the
united
states

at
the
risk
of
his
popularity
and
of
his


place


are
we
to
think
it
a
mere
effect
of
chance

or
only
a


coincidence

that
the
flag
of
the
constitutional
monarchy

as
the
sole


alternative
of
anarchy
in
france

is
supported
by
the
descendants
of


montesquieu

by
the
heirs
of
guizot

and
by
the
son
of
this
duc
de


broglie
to
whose
courage
and
integrity
france
and
america
were
indebted


for
the
equitable
settlement
of
an
international
dispute
originally


provoked
by
the
vulgar
folly
and
impertinence
of
the
first
french


republic
and
of
the
disreputable
envoys

genet
and
fauchet

whom
it
sent


one
after
the
other
to
the
united
states
with
orders
to
appeal
from
the


government
of
president
washington
to
the
american
people






it
was
by
the

military
council

made
up
of
officers
trained
in
the


school
of
the
great
marechal
de
broglie

and
not
by
the
vapouring
and


venal
demagogues
of
the
convention

that
france
was
successfully


organised
to
resist
the
austro
prussian
invasion
of


and
it
was
by


the
government
of
which
the
present
duc
de
broglie
was
a
leading
member


under
the
marechal
duc
de
magenta

not
by
m

gambetta
and
m

jules


ferry

that
the
third
republic
was
so
administered
when
the
fortunes
of


france
were
at
their
lowest
ebb
as
to
re
establish
the
finances

restore


the
credit

and
renew
the
military
strength
of
the
french
nation






for
now
more
than
two
centuries
the
name
of
de
broglie
has
been
made


historical
in
france

not
by
the
favour
of
princes

for
neither
in
the


camp
nor
in
the
cabinet
have
the
de
broglies
ever
been
courtiers

nor


yet
by
the
applause
of
the
populace

but
by
the
personal
ability

the


personal
character

and
the
public
services
of
the
men
who
have
borne


it

if
ever
a
man
died
for
his
loyalty
to
liberty
and
the
law

it
was


victor
charles
de
broglie
in


his
son

the
earliest
and
most


faithful
ally
in
france
of
clarkson
and
wilberforce
in
their
long


crusade
against
negro
slavery

never
sought

but
accepted
his
place


among
the
peers
of
france
after
the
restoration

such
was
his
absolute


independence
that
his
first
act
in
the
upper
chamber
under
louis
xviii



was
to
record
his
solitary
but
emphatic
protest
against
the


condemnation
of
marshal
ney

his
political
career
recalls
seneca
s


theory
of
ulysses


nauseator

but
fulfilling
his
odyssey

he
disliked


but
never
shirked
the
responsibilities
which
were
pressed
upon
him

it


used
to
be
said
of
m

thiers
that
whenever
louis
philippe
wished
to
get


an
unpopular
measure
carried

he
contrived
to
make
m

thiers
oppose
it


violently

upset
the
government
upon
it

come
into
power
upon
his


victory

and
then
take
the
measure
up
himself
and
carry
it
through

the


duc
de
broglie
was
not
a
politician
of
this
adroit
and
acrobatic
type



his
yea
was
yea
and
his
nay

nay
in
politics
as
in
private
life

he
kept


aloof
from
the
second
empire

as
his
grandfather

mr

carlyle
s

war
god


broglie


had
kept
aloof
from
the
first

but
he
never
fell
into
the


republican
folly
of
pretending
to
regard
the
second
empire
as
a
tyranny


imposed
upon
the
people
of
france
against
their
will

on
the
contrary



he
saw
things
not
as
he
wished
them
to
be

but
as
they
were

and
so
he


said
of
the
second
empire


it
is
the
government
which
the
masses
of
the


people
in
france
desire
and
which
the
upper
classes
of
france
deserve







the
sting
of
this
saying
was
given
to
it
by
the
acquiescence
of
the



upper
classes

in
the
blow
struck
by
the
second
empire
at
the
rights
of


property
in
france
when
it
confiscated
in

the
estates
of
the
house


of
orleans

this
blow
was
aimed

of
course

by
napoleon
iii

at
the


monarchy
of
july

just
as
the
blow
struck
by
napoleon
at
the
duc


d
enghien
was
aimed
at
the
ancient
monarchy

but
in
the
one
case
as
in


the
other

the
iniquity
of
the
blow
affected
the
fundamental
conditions


of
social
order
and
peace
in
france

in
the
one
case
as
in
the
other

an


imperial
government

assuming
to
be
a
government
of
law

committed


itself
to
the
most
outrageous
and
despotic
practices
of
the

terror

of




in
the
charter
of


louis
xviii

had
abolished
confiscation



in
the
charter
of


louis

re
affirmed
this
abolition



by
the
decrees
of


seizing
the
property
of
the
house
of
orleans



napoleon
iii

re
established
confiscation

in
principle
these
decrees
of



were
no
better
than
the
jacobin
decrees
of
september


which


fixed
the
proportion
of
his
own
income
to
be
enjoyed
by
every
citizen
in


france

real

the
chairman

as
we
should
call
him

of
the
finance


committee
of
the
convention
of


who
calmly
divided
the
income
of


every
citizen
into
three
categories


the
necessary

not
to
exceed

in


the
case
of
a
bachelor



francs
a
year


the
abundant

not
to


exceed


francs

of
which
one
half
should
go
to
the
state

and
the



superfluous


the
whole
of
which
must

paid
into
the
public
treasury



was
a
good
jacobin
when
he
made
this
classification

he
lived
to
become


a
good
imperialist

and
to
accept
from
the
emperor
the
title
of
count



with
a
very
large

superfluous

income

of
which
he
made
very
good
use


for
his
own
private
pleasure
and
satisfaction

the
question
as
to
these


decrees
of

was
brought
up
before
the
national
assembly
on
september






by
the
comte
de
merode

who


in
the
name
of
justice
and
of


common
honesty


insisted
that
the
treasury
should
cease
to
receive
for


public
uses
the
income
of
the
private
property
of
the
orleans
family



illegally
confiscated
by
the
decrees
of
january









the
government
of
the
republic
at
once
responded
that

the


responsibility
of
this
act
of
spoliation
belonged
exclusively
to
its


author

and
the
subject
was
referred
to
a
committee

this
committee


reported
in

a
law
founded

in
the
plain
language
of
the
committee



upon
that
principle
of
common
honesty
which
forbids

man
to
enrich


himself
at
the

expense
of
his
neighbour


the
report
states
that
of
the



fifty
one
direct
descendants
then
living
of
king
louis
philippe

not


one

to
their
honour
be
it
said

had
addressed
any
request
on
the


subject

either
to
the
government
or
to
the
assembly


it
states
also



that
having
examined
the
subject
carefully

the
committee
were


unanimously
of
the
opinion
that
it
was
the
duty
of
france

to
restore
to


the
owners
of
this
property
what
belonged
to
them

no
longer
to
keep
in


the
hands
of
the
state
what
had
never
belonged
to
the
state


the


committee

considering
the
frightful
disasters
brought
upon
france
by


the
war
of



could
not
recommend

said
the
report


that
the


treasury
should
now
undertake
absolutely
to
repair
the
consequences
of


an
act
repudiated
by
france

what
it
recommended
was

that
the
orleans


family
should
be
put
into
possession
of
all
that
was
left
of
its
own


property

not
that
it
should
receive
back
the
equivalent
of
the
sums


already
consumed
and
dissipated


at
that
time
the
treasury
had


alienated
under
the
decrees
of

no
less
than



francs
of


this
lawful
property
of
the
orleans
family

unlawfully
seized
and


confiscated

the
whole
property

when
seized
in


was
estimated
by


the
committee
of

at



francs

between

and

the


treasury
had
received
and
spent



francs
from
sales
of
this


property

it
had
also
received
and
spent

from
the
sale
of
timber
cut
in


the
forests
belonging
to
the
property




francs

putting
this


large
sum
aside

it
is
obvious
that
in
the
shape
of
property
actually


sold

to
the
amount
in
round
numbers
of



francs

between



and


and
of
the
interest
on
this
amount
during
the
same
time

the


imperial
government
had
really
converted
to
its
own
uses





francs
which
did
not
belong
to
it

not
one
penny
of
these
millions
of


francs
was
restored
to
its
owners
by
the
decrees
of


what
the


decrees
of

accomplished

with
the
approval
of
such
extreme


republicans
as
m

henri
brisson

was
to
put
a
stop
to
this
public


robbery
of
private
owners

the
orleans
estates
not
yet
sold
in

were


then
estimated
to
yield
an
income
of



francs

before
final


action
was
taken
by
the
assembly

the
orleans
princes
voluntarily
came


forward
and
announced
that
they
would
accept
no

restitution

at
the


expense
of
the
taxpayers
of
france
of
their
property
sold
and
alienated


under
the
spoliation
of


and
the
text
of
the
law
as
finally
passed


in

expressly
ordains
that

conformably
to
the
renunciation
offered


before
the
presentation
of
the
bill
by
the
heirs
of
king
louis
philippe



and
since
renewed


their
unsold
property


real
and
personal

seized
by


the
state
and
not
alienated
before
this
date

be
immediately
restored
to


its
owners


as
a
matter
of
fact

therefore

under
this
law

the
heirs


of
king
louis
philippe
actually
made
the
french
government
a
present
in



of
many
millions
of
francs

which
belonged
to
them
and
did
not


belong
to
france
or
to
the
french
government

by
doing
this

they


co
operated
most
creditably
with
every
man
of
common
honesty
in
the


french
assembly
in
repairing
the
wrong
done
to
every
french
citizen
by


the
decrees
of
january




decrees
justly
described
by
m

pascal


duprat
in
the
chamber

on
november




as

decrees
of
flat


spoliation
which
had
violated
the
sacred
right
of
property

disregarded


the
fundamental
rules
of
law

and
profoundly
wounded
the
public


conscience


however
profoundly
wounded
the
public
conscience
may
have


been
by
these
decrees
in


the
scornful
words
of
the
duc
de
broglie


attest
that
it
suffered
in
silence
and
for
twenty
years
made
no


adequate
outward
sign






this
cool
and
caustic
statesman
was
born
and
brought
up
in
the
catholic


church

he
married
a
protestant
lady

one
of
the
most
charming
and


brilliant
women
of
her
time

the
daughter
of
madame
de
stael

and
he
was


the
intimate
friend
and
associate
throughout
his
public
life
of
m



guizot

his
son

the
present
duke

grew
up
in
an
atmosphere
of
practical


religious
liberality

it
was
the
law
of

restricting
the
state


monopoly
of
the
higher
branches
of
public
education
in
france
which


concentrated
against
the
present
duke

under
the
marechal
duc
de


magenta

the
whole
strength
of
the
anti
religious
elements
in
france

it


was
not
to
prevent
the
restoration
of
the
monarchy
by
men
like
the
duc


de
magenta
and
the
duc
de
broglie

whom
he
well
knew
to
be
incapable
of


conspiring
for
any
object
whatever

that
m

gambetta
uttered
his


war
cry



le
clericalisme
c
est
l
ennemi



it
was
to
rally
behind


himself
and
his
own
associates
in
the
republican
party
the
great
army
of


the
socialistic
radicals
in
france

it
was
to
make
the
conservative


republic
of
the
duc
de
magenta
and
the
duc
de
broglie
impossible

that


the
parliamentary
conspirators
of

conceived
and
carried
out

under


cover
of
this
war
cry

their
scheme
for
suppressing
the
executive
in


france

they
have

as
i
believe

succeeded

they
have
made
the


conservative
republic
impossible

what
is
the
result

the
result
is
that


no
alternative
of
anarchy
is
left
to
sensible
and
moderate
men
in
france


but
the
monarchy






this
has
been
growing
more
and
more
apparent
ever
since


in
that


year
the
legislative
elections
were
made
under
the

scrutin
de
liste




and
when
the
government
rallied
after
the
shock
of
the
first


conservative
attack

almost
all
the
seats
left
in
peril
by
that
attack


were

saved

at
the
supplementary
election
by
surrendering
them
to


radical
candidates

in


under
the
fear
of
boulanger

the

scrutin


de
liste

was
suddenly
abandoned
for
the

scrutin
d
arrondissement


and


the
same
thing
happened
again






at
the
first
election

on
september



candidates
of
all
parties


were
chosen
in
the

departments
of
france

of
these


were


government
republicans
and

radicals

at
the
second
election

on


october


the
remaining

seats
were
filled

of
these


were


carried
by
the
government
republicans

and
no
fewer
than

surrendered


to
the
radicals

in
other
words

at
the
first
election
the
radicals


secured
just
about
a
quarter
of
the

seats
carried
by
the


republicans

at
the
second
election
they
secured
very
nearly
one
half
of


the

seats
carried
by
the
republicans

so
that
the
radicals
finally


muster

out
of
the

republican
home
members
of
the
present


chamber

and
are

therefore

practically
masters
of
the
situation
so
far


as
the
republic
is
concerned

they
made
this
perfectly
clear
as
soon
as


the
chamber
met
by
insisting
upon
and
securing
the
election
of
m



floquet

a
radical
of
the
advanced
left
wing

as
president
of
the


chamber

were
the
radicals
to
withdraw
their
support
from
the
government


on
any
issue

it
would
be
left
with

members
to
face
a
combined


opposition
vote
of

members

which
might
at
any
moment
be
converted


into
a
hostile
majority
by
the
action
of
less
than
a
third
of
the


radicals

when
we
remember
that
these

radicals
are
represented
in


the
chair
of
the
chamber
by
a
leader
who
was
locked
up
for
a
year
in



for
his
participation
in
the
revolt
of
the
commune

and
who
voted


in

for
the
full
pardon
of
the
convicts
of
the
commune

it
will
be


obvious

i
think

that
the
republicans

have
committed
suicide
to
save


themselves
from
slaughter







m

floquet

imprisoned
in

for
complicity
with
the
commune

was
made


prefect
of
the
seine
in

by
the
men
who
have
since
made
m

carnot


president
of
the
republic

as
president
of
the
chamber

m

floquet



under
the
existing
regime
in
france

is
now
the
superior
of
m

carnot



can
there
be
any
mistake
as
to
the
meaning
of
this

in


as
prefect


of
the
seine

m

floquet
maintained
the
closest
relations
with
the


municipal
council
of
paris

m

ferry
s
bill
making
primary
education


obligatory

and

laicizing

that
education

finally
became
law
on
july






the
war
against
god
in
the
schools
began
at
once
vigorously



and
nowhere
more
vigorously
than
in
paris

m

paul
bert
had
insisted

in


his
report
of


upon
the
importance
of
protecting
teachers
who
were


scientific
and
philosophical
atheists
against
the
pangs
their


consciences
would
suffer
were
they
obliged
to
read
or
to
hear
recited


passages
from

what
is
called
sacred
history

that
is
to
say

a
mixture


of
positive
history

with
legends
which
have
no
value
except
in
the
eyes


of
believers


in
this
spirit
of
the
peddler
who
tried
to

scrub
out
the


blood
stains

at
holyrood
the
law
of

was
conceived

how
it
was


executed
we
learn
from
m

zevort

a
distinguished
inspector
of
the


academy
of
paris

and
by
no
means
a
catholic

in
some
places
the


authorities
ordered
the
words

love
god

respect
your
parents


to
be


effaced
from
the
school
house
walls

in
others

children
were
compelled


to
give
up
the
catechisms
which
they
had
brought
with
them
to
school



intending
to
go
on
after
school
hours
to
the
parish
church

in
this
same


year
m

fournier
stated
in
the
senate
that
persons
appointed
by
the


minister
of
public
instruction
to
distribute
prizes
in
the
schools
had


made
speeches
to
the
children
in
which
they
spoke
of
all
religion
as


mere
superstition

he
cited
one
such
orator
as
contrasting

scientific


education

the
only
true
education

which
gives
man
the
certainty
of
his


own
value
and
urges
him
onward
to
progress
and
to
the
light


with



religious
education
which
fatally
plunges
him
into
a
murky
night

and


an
abyss
of
deadly
superstitions


another
luminary
of
the
state


exclaimed
in
a
burst
of
eloquence


young
citizenesses
and
young


citizens

we
have
been
accused
of
banishing
god
from
the
schools

it
is


an
error

nothing
can
be
driven
out
which
does
not
exist

now
god
does


not
exist

what
we
have
suppressed
is
only
a
set
of
emblems







these
emblems
were
the
religious
inscriptions

and
the
crucifixes

taken


out
of
the
school
houses

of
these
emblems
the
prefect
of
the
seine

in




carelessly
observed
in
the
course
of
an
enquiry
before
the
senate



that
the
removal
of
them
was

only
a
question
of
school
furniture


and


the
municipal
council
of
paris

with
which
m

floquet
in

so


cordially
co
operated

formally
adopted
resolutions
calling
for
the


complete
suppression
in
all
the
primary
schools

of
all
theological


instruction
whatsoever



no
one


said
one
councillor

m

cattiaux



with
much
solemnity


can
prove
the
existence
of
god

and
our
teachers


must
not
be
compelled
to
affirm
the
existence
of
an
imaginary
being







with
m

floquet
as
president
of
the
chamber

m

carnot
and
his
ministers


are
at
the
mercy
not
of
the
radicals
only

but
of
the
radical
allies
of


the
commune

the
french
monarchists
to
day
are
fighting
out
the
battle


of
religion
and
of
civilization
for
every
country
in
christendom






though
the
calvados
was
the
chosen
home
of
m

guizot

it
was
not
his


birthplace

like
m

thiers

whom
he
so
little
resembled
in
other


particulars

m

guizot
was
a
son
of
the
south

he
was
born
at
nimes

in


the
gard

a
city
rather
republican
than
royalist
by
its
traditions

even


under
the
old
monarchy

his
father
was
an
advocate

and
by
the
charter


of
nimes

which
organized
in

the

consular

government
of
the
city



it
was
provided
that
the
first
consul
of
nimes
should
always
be
taken


from
among

the
advocates
graduated
and
versed
in
the
law


the
second


consulate
only
being
left
open
to

citizens

merchants

and
graduated


physicians







as
the
fifteenth
century
is
commonly
admitted
to
have
been
a

feudal



century

this
provision
attests
the
power
of
the
robe
as
against
the


sword
in
a
very
interesting
way

and
at
an
interesting
point
in
french


history

the
local
nobility
felt
the
slight
put
upon
them
very
strongly



and
made
great
efforts
to
have
the
system
changed

these
efforts
were


not
successful
till
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century

in

the
duc
de


montmorency

governor
of
languedoc

issued
a
decree
convoking
the


council
general
to
consider
the
subject

and
this
assembly

after
a


stormy
session

decided
that

the
noblemen
and
gentlemen
of
the
province


should
hold
the
first
consulate
alternately
with
the
advocates


the


first
nobleman
of
languedoc
who
profited
by
this
decision
was
louis
de


montcalm

an
ancestor
of
the
illustrious
defender
of
quebec

he
became


first
consul
of
nimes
in


the
year
after
the
defeat
of
the
great


spanish
armada
against
england

he
was
a
huguenot

and
nimes
in
the
days


of
the
great
religious
wars
had
become
a
protestant
stronghold
after
its


capture
by
the
huguenots
on
november




the
huguenot
de
calviere



baron
de
st

cosme

who
took
a
leading
part
in
that
military
adventure



was
made
governor
of
nimes
and
a
gentleman
of
the
king
s
bedchamber
by


henry
of
navarre






as
a
protestant
and
as
an
advocate

the
father
of
m

guizot
naturally


inclined
to
the
republican
theory
of
government
in


he
very
soon


and
as
naturally
opened
his
eyes
to
the
abominations
of
the
republican


practice

and
in
due
course
came
to
the
guillotine
under
the
terror

to


the
day
of
her
death
his
widow
wore
the
deepest
mourning
for
him

and


his
son

like
the
son
of
the
murdered
victor
charles
de
broglie



honoured
his
memory
by
an
inflexible
loyalty
to
the
principles
of


justice
and
of
liberty
for
which
his
father
had
died






i
was
not
surprised

therefore

to
find
m

guillaume
guizot

the


protestant
son
of
the
great
protestant
statesman

at
his
pleasant
rural


home
near
uzes
as
earnest
and
active
in
the
summer
of

in
organizing


the
monarchical
party
for
the
legislative
elections

as
the
staunchest


catholics
of

picturesque

interesting
town



and
its
electoral
district

a
gallant
stand
for
liberty

the

it
gave
nearly


monarchist
against
about




republican
votes

and
the
returns
of
the

it
has
been
a
point
of
attack

leaders

is
a
tale
of
horror
still
in

the
memories
of


the
long
and
merciless
strife
between
the
catholics
and
the
protestants


of

are
fresher
still
and
more
intense

m

guillaume


guizot
well
remembers
the
bitterness
of
the
passions
roused
at
nimes
by


the
local
struggles
between
the

two
religions

which
followed
the


restoration

his
father
was
one
day
reasoning
on
the
subject
with
a


protestant
citizen
of
nimes

who
suddenly
pointed
to
a
man
passing
on


the
other
side
of
the
street

and
said


that
man
had
a
hand
in
the


killing
of
my
father
here
in
the
streets
of
nimes

how
can
you
ask
me
to


forget
that







the
republicans
of
the
third
republic

bent
on
coercing
france
into
a



moral
unity

of
atheism

are
fast
making
both
catholics
and
protestants


forget
such
things
in
the
imminence
of
a
new
and
common
peril
to
the


liberties
and
the
rights
of
both

the
two
daughters
of
m

guizot

as
is


well
known

married
two
brothers

the
heirs
and
representatives
of
the


great
protestant
and
republican
family
of

of
these


brothers

m

cornelis
de
witt

the
namesake


of
the
statesman
for
whom
his
illustrious
brother
the
grand
pensionary


of
holland
sacrificed
his
own
life
in
a
vain
effort
to
save
him
from
the


brutal
fury
of
an
ignorant
and
frantic
multitude
at
the
hague

has
just


been
taken

in
the
full
force
of
his
energies
and
his
great
ability



from
the
love
of
his
friends
and
from
the
cause
of
liberty
in
france

as


a
deputy
and
a
member
of
the
government
he
took
an
active
part
in
the


re
establishment
of
the
finances
and
the
public
organisation
of
france


after
the
disasters
of



as
a
director
of
the
great
mines
at


auzin

and
as
vice
president
of
the
paris

lyons

and
mediterranean


railway
company

he
was
in
close
and
constant
touch
with
the
working


classes
of
france
and
with
the
great
material
interests
of
a
country


which
he
loved
as
his
ancestors
loved
holland

this
is
not
the
place
in


which
to
speak
of
the
personal
gifts
and
graces
which
will
keep
the
name


of
m

cornelis
de
witt
green
in
the
memory
of
all
who
knew
him

but
of


his
great
qualities
as
a
citizen

and
of
the
judgment
absolutely


unwarped
by
passion
or
by
prejudice
which
gave
weight
to
all
his


political
convictions

it
is
the
place
to
speak

after
a
fair
and


serious
experiment

in
which
he
took
his
part
loyally

at
founding
in


france
the

conservative
republic

of
m

thiers

he
thought
that
outlook


for
the
future
completely
and
hopelessly
closed

and
as
it
was
neither


in
the
traditions
of
netherlandish
liberty
nor
in
his
own
virile
and


courageous
temper
to
acquiesce
in
the
domination
of
a
political


oligarchy
ready

like
carrier
and
the
jacobins
of


to

make
france


one
vast
cemetery
rather
than
not
regenerate
it
after
their
own
minds




m

cornelis
de
witt
looked
about
him
calmly
for
a
way
of
escape






this
way
he
found
where
the
sagacious
netherlanders
of
the
seventeenth


century
found
it
after
the
hard
won
liberties
of
holland
had
been


prostrated
by
the
mad
revolt
of
a
misled
multitude
against
the


government
of
the
grand
pensionary

who
had
held
his
own
against


cromwell
and
against
louis
xiv


made
holland
the
first
naval
power
of


the
world

and
scared
london
with
the
thunder
of
the
dutch
cannon
in
the


thames

nothing
but
the
restoration
of
the
hereditary
principle
in
the


person
of
william
of
orange
saved
amsterdam
and
rotterdam
from
falling


at
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century

as
they
fell
at
the
end
of
the


eighteenth

under
the
dominion
of
an
invader

when
the
hereditary


principle
was
again
abandoned
after
the
death
of
william
of
orange

the


domestic
peace
as
well
as
the
national
prestige
of
holland
vanished
with


it

and
though
the
dutch
people
in
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century


insisted
upon
seeing
it
for
a
time
restored

the
power
of
the
dutch


executive
towards
the
end
of
the
century
was
so
much
hampered
and


weakened
by
the
local
jealousies
of
the
provinces

that
in
the


convention
which
framed
the
constitution
of
the
united
states

mr



butler

who
had
travelled
much
in
the
low
countries

successfully


enforced
the
necessity
of
making
the
american
executive
monarchical
by
a


vivid
description
of
the
evils
inflicted
upon
holland
by
her
departures


from
that
principle

we
took
warning
as
to
the
perils
of
the
union
from


the
example
of
the
low
countries

and
as
to
the
importance
of
the


executive
from
the
example
of
great
britain

there
were
many
americans


indeed
in


men
of
worth
and
of
weight
both
in
private
and
in
public


affairs

who
rather
than
accept
edmund
randolph
s
plan
of
confiding
the


executive
authority
to
a
triumvirate

would
have
given
their
adhesion
to


the
seriously
mooted
project
of
making
the
american
executive
absolutely


hereditary

and
inviting
the
prince
bishop
of
osnaburg
to
accept
the


office






the
convictions
of
m

cornelis
de

are
represented
now
with
equal


energy
and
determination
in
normandy
by
his

and
by

near

in

stands
in
the
heart
of
a
land
of
fruits
and
vines

from


the
terrace
of

chateau
of

the
eye
ranges
over
a
fine


expanse
of
the
valley
of

which
at
no
great
distance
from


tonneins
mingles
with
the
lot
beneath
the
promontory
of
nicole

the


landscape
is
rich
in
colour

great
fields
of
tobacco
alternate
with


extensive
orchards

it
is
a
land
to
be
seen
in
the
season
of
blossoms



the
world
famed
prunes
of
bordeaux
come
mainly
from
about
agen

and
the


pleasant
little
commune
of
nicole
probably
draws
a
much
larger
tribute


to
day
from
london

in
exchange
for
its
precocious
apricots

than
it


ever
paid
to
london
when
the
plantagenet
eaglets
were
rending
the
eagle


of
winchester

the
old
traditions
of
guienne
seem
to
be
much
less
vivid


than
those
of
normandy
or
brittany

i
have
heard
bretons
speak
of
the


duchess
anne
as
the
scotch
jacobites
still
speak
of
the
stuarts

but


though
coeur
de
lion
is
still
a
popular
hero
in
the
land
of
bertrand


de
born

there
is
nothing
there
like
the
provencal
feeling
in
provence



at
st

remy

the
beautiful
birthplace
of
nostradamus

a
lively
waiter
in


the
excellent
hotel
of
the

cheval
blanc


taking
me
for
a
frenchman
of


the
north

contrived
very
skilfully
to
let
me
know
that
the
provencals


do
not
hold
themselves
responsible
for
the
failure
of
northern
france
to


repulse
the
germans


if
the
comte
de
paris
had
not
got
the
better
long


ago
of
the
comte
de
provence


he
informed
me


france
would
have
been


provencal
and
not
provence
french

and
then
things
would
have
gone


differently
altogether


but
all
languedoc
is
as
proud
of
its
language


as
wales

a
youth
who
took
me
at
agen
to
see
the
shop
and
house
of
the



barber
bard

was
clearly
of
the
opinion
that
the
poetry
of
lamartine


and
victor
hugo
would
have
been
as
fine
as
the
poetry
of
jasmin
had
they


been
so
fortunate
as
to
use
his
mother
tongue


the
french
language
was


a
kind
of
gallic
patois
mixed
with
german

while
the
true
langue
d
oc



as
i
must
know

was
the
language
of
the
romans


this
same
philologist


took
me
also
to
the
little
valley
of

verona


where
he
showed
me
not


only
a
small
vineyard

the
property
of
jasmin

but
the
house

the


fountain

and
the
huge
stone
chair
of
scaliger


a
great
philosopher


descended
from
julius
caesar


joseph
scaliger

i
believe

was
really


born
in
this
house

which
was
given
to
his
illustrious
father
by
the


bishop
of
agen

and
joseph
with
his
own
eyes
saw
some
three
hundred


huguenots
burnt
alive
in
agen
on
the
great
place
du
gravier

where
now


the
annual
fairs
of
agen
are
held
under
the
stately
elms






the
lands
of
the
lot
et
garonne
are
full
of
memories
of
the
english


wars

of
the
albigensian
crusade

of
the
long
duel
between
the
church


and
the
calvinists

tonneins

once
a
curious

double
city

of
the


middle
ages

was
destroyed
in
the
seventeenth
century
by
louis
xiii



for
its
fidelity
to
the
huguenot
cause

nerac

where
jeanne
d
albret
and


the
two
margots
held
their
gay
and
gallant
courts

and
henry
of
navarre


established
his
headquarters
during

the
lovers

war


suffered
as


severely
for
the
like
cause
under
louis
xiv

the
revocation
of
the
edict


of
nantes
sent
its
most
industrious
inhabitants
into
exile

not
a
few
of


them
crossing
the
atlantic
to
join
the
huguenot
colonies
in
new
york
and


in
the
carolinas


but
the
revolution
of

did
nerac
more
harm


said


an
intelligent
tradesman
of
the
picturesque
little
city
to
me


than
the


revocation

the
revocation
drove
away
many
honest
people
from
nerac

but


the
revolution
brought
here
a
great
many
rogues


the
country
around


nerac
is
extremely
fertile

and
great
prizes
were
to
be
picked
up
here


during
the
decade
of
proscription
and
confiscation

the
garenne

one
of


the
loveliest
public
parks
in
france

in
which
a
beautiful
fountain


sparkles
and
murmurs
beneath
two
lofty
elms
planted
by
henry
of
navarre


and
marguerite
de
valois

was
actually
bought
during
the
first
consulate


by
the
city
for
a
little
over
five
thousand
francs

or
two
hundred


pounds
sterling

the
war
of

against

privileges

soon
became
in


nerac

as
elsewhere
in
france

a
war
against
property

the
immediate


effect
of
this
was
not

what
we
are
constantly
told
it
was

to
increase


the
wealth
of
france
by

redistributing

it
amongst
the
active
and


industrious
classes

it
was

on
the
contrary

to
diminish
the
wealth
of


france
by
lowering
the
real
value
of
property

this
is
clearly
shown
by


the
extraordinary
pains
which
napoleon
took
to
enforce
respect
for
the


rights
of
property
as
soon
as
he
grasped
the
supreme
power
in
the
state



but
one
comes
everywhere
upon
striking
local
proofs
of
it

at
najac
in


the
department
of
the
aveyron

for
example

the
obliging
hotel
keeper


will
give
you
the
key
of
one
of
the
most
magnificent
ruined
castles
in


southern
france

which

with
its
grand
donjon

and
all
the
massive


circle
of
its
walls
and
ramparts

was
seized
and
sold

during
the


terror

for

twelve
francs


the
purchaser
made
a
deal
of
money
by


converting
the
castle
into
a
quarry

and
when
law
and
order
were


restored

he
gladly
parted
with
his
very
dubious
title
for
the
highly


respectable
advance
on
his
investment
of


francs

as
a
piece
of


successful

gerrymandering

the
republican
treatment
of
this
department


of
the
aveyron

by
the
way

in
the
elections
of


is
worth


mentioning

in


under
the

scrutin
de
liste


the
aveyron
was


entitled
to
six
deputies

it
elected
a
solid
conservative


representation

in


under
the

scrutin
d
arrondissement


the


government
carved
out
seven
seats
for
the
aveyron

and
the
electoral


districts
were
so
ingeniously
framed
as
to
secure
two
out
of
these
seven


seats
for
the
republicans

though
the
total
of
the
votes
cast
in
the


department
showed
a
clear
majority
for
the
monarchists
of








we
had
a
banquet
of
mayors
while
i
was
at
peyreguilhot

not
such
a


belshazzar
s
feast
as
m

constans
gave
at
paris
to
the
thirteen


thousand

but
a
simple
and
interesting
gathering
of
about
a
dozen


intelligent
and
active
elective
magistrates

under
a
recent
law
all


mayors

except
in
paris

are
now
chosen
by
the
councils

but
the


government
can
revoke
their
commissions

our
guests
at
peyreguilhot
were


all
shrewd

quiet

active
men
of
the
country


we
shall
be
beaten
in


september


said
one
of
them
to
me


because
the
government
employs
men


enough
to
beat
us

moreover

our
farmers
say


why
vote
at
all

for
the


mayors
and
the
prefect
throw
our
votes
out
and
cheat
us


then

too

we


must
have
a
man
to
vote
for
before
we
can
make
them
move

they
will
not


vote
for
the
monarchy
as
a
principle

but
give
them
a
man
who
touches


their
imaginations
and
they
will
make
him
a
monarch


they
voted
for


louis
napoleon
as
soon
as
they
saw
him
take
the
assembly
resolutely
by


the
throat

they
would
have
voted

overwhelmingly

for
boulanger
on


september

had
he
suddenly
reappeared
in
paris

demanding
a
revision


of
the
verdict
of
the
high
court






this
is
true

i
think

not
of
the
lot
et
garonne
alone

but
of
all


france

it
has
been
signally
illustrated
since
the
elections
of

by


what
stendhal
would
have
called
the
rapid

crystallization

of
public


sympathy
around
the
young
duc
d
orleans
when
he
suddenly
appeared
in


paris

the
government
was
completely
bewildered
and
demoralized
by
this



bolt
out
of
the
blue


instead
of
quietly
reconducting
the
prince
to


the
frontier
with
a
reprimand
for
his
inconsiderate
and
unconventional


patriotism

it
stupidly
locked
him
up
in
a
prison
haunted
by
legends


disgraceful
to
the
republic

proceeded
against
him
with
clumsy


vehemence

gave
him
time
to
show
himself
to
the
french
people

in
the


words
of
the
duc
d
aumale

as
a


pur
sang



a
straightforward

dashing


young
french
prince
demanding
the
right
of
performing
his
military
duty


to
the
state

had
him
condemned

tardily
resolved
to
pardon
him

and


wound
up
finally
by
sending
him
to
clairvaux
to
placate
the
criminal


bullies
of
the
commune






what
has
been
the
result

it
cannot
be
more
exactly
stated
than
in
the


words
of
the
official
organ
of
the
russian
empire
at
brussels


le


nord


a
journal
certainly
not
predisposed
in
favour
of
the
house
of


orleans
by
the
success
of
the
orleanist
prince
ferdinand
in
bulgaria




the
appearance
of
this
young
exile


said

le
nord



on
the
soil
of


france

not
as
a
pretender
or
with
political
ideas

but
simply
as
a


frenchman
coming
to
establish
his
moral
rights
as
a
citizen
by
claiming


to
be
allowed
to
perform
his
civic
duties

and
this
with
a
rare


combination
of
youthful
dash

irreproachable
modesty

and
skilful


self
possession
was
admirably
fitted
to
awaken

and
it
has
awakened

the


sympathy
of
all
who
are
politically
disinterested







this
is
strong
language
coming
from
the
only
great
power
in
the
world
to


which
france
can
look
as
a
possible
ally
in
the
present
condition
of


europe

it
was
emphasised
by
the
ablest
and
most
active
of
the
french


imperialists

m

paul
de
cassagnac


to
keep
this
young
prince
in
prison


is
impossible

to
do
so
would
make
him
king
of
france
within
three


years

to
let
him
go

after
keeping
him
for
a
week

is
no
longer
a


generous
and
magnanimous
act

it
is
simply
obeying
the
vigorous
kick


administered
by
the
masters
of
the
government

the
french
people

who


have
been
saying
of
the
orleans
princes


they
won
t
move


and
who
now


see
a
young
duc
d
orleans
move
forward
with
a
gay
virility
which
has
a


flavour
of
henri
iv


if
the
young
duc
d
orleans
is
as
intelligent
as
i


am
told

and
believe
that
he
is

he
wouldn
t
change

to
day







every

ministerial
crisis

which
weakens
the
government
will
strengthen


the
prestige
acquired
for
the
monarchy
by
the
young
duke

he
has
won
the


women
by
his
pluck

the
fathers
of
families
by
his
deference
to
the


comte
de
paris

the
catholics
by
asking
for
a
chaplain
at
clairvaux

and


the

chauvins

by
his
military
ardour






a
friend
of
mine
showed
me
in
paris
ten
days
after
the
arrest
of
the


prince
a
letter
from
normandy

in
which
the
writer
said


millions
of


francs
would
not
have
done
what
has
been
done
by
this
simple
act
to


revive
and
invigorate
the
monarchical
party
throughout
this
whole


region





le
petit
conscrit

will
be
the
prince
of
the
people
from


this
day
forth

the
gray
beards
among
the
peasants
shake
their
heads
and


say


all
the
same

it
is
not
such
a
nice
thing

this
conscription

and


since
he
was
out
of
it
why
run
into
it


but
the
women
reply


since
our


lads
have
to
go
in

it
is
plucky
of
the
comte
de
paris
to
put
his
son
in


too








to
make
a
handsome
young
prince
a
martyr
of
patriotism
in
the
eyes
of


the
women
and
the
conscripts
of
france

is
a
highly
original
way
of


blocking
the
progress
of
his
father
to
the
throne






the
mayors
at
peyreguilhot
were
all
of
one
mind
as
to
the
fiscal
conduct


of
the
republican
government

it
was

making
life
impossible
for
the


agriculturists
of
all
categories

the
tax
on
the
revenue
of
the
land
in


the
lot
et
garonne
was
levied
still
on
a

cadastre

drawn
up
in


so


that
lands
now
lying
idle
were
taxed
as
they
were
taxed
fifty
years
ago


when
covered
with
vines

thanks
to
this
system

forty
two
departments
in


france
pay
more
than
their
due
proportion
of
this
tax

and
the
others


less
than
their
due
proportion

the
aude

which
is
a
very
rich


department

producing

if
you
take
good
and
bad
years
together

more


than



francs
of
wine
alone
every
year

pays
a
million
of


francs
less

and
the
lot
et
garonne
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
million
more



than
its
due
share
of
this
tax







m

de
witt
confirmed
these
statements

the
inequalities
in
national


taxation

he
tells
me

are
one
of
the
crying
grievances
of
france
under


the
existing
regime

corsica

for
example

pays
only
ninety
five


centimes

per
cent


of
revenue
tax

while
the
correze
pays
seven
francs


ninety
cents

and
there
is
one
commune
in
the
gironde
which
actually


pays
ninety
francs
per
cent

besides
the
people
pay
the
door
and
window


tax

the
furniture
tax

the

prestations
en
nature


the
permanent


personal
tax

and
the
octrois
and
the

centimes
additionnels

levied
for


educational
and
other
purposes






the
taxes
levied
as

centimes
additionnels

for
the
departments
of


france
increased
from

to

by



francs

and
the
taxes


levied
as

centimes
additionnels

for
the
communes

exclusive
of
paris



by



francs

while
from

to

the
total
of
the
debts
of


the
communes
increased
at
the
rate
of



francs
a
year

the


departmental
loans
during
the
same
period
increased
no
less
than

per


cent


or
from



francs
in

to



francs
in







since
the
new
chamber
met
the
air
has
been
full
of
rumours
of
new
loans



and
of
modifications
of
taxation

these
modifications
may
ease
the


pressure
on
one
point

but
only
by
increasing
it
upon
another
point

no


financier
in
france
pretends
to
put
the
annual
burden
borne
by
the


french
people
at
much
less
than
double
the
annual
taxation
of
great


britain

m

meline

a
republican
of
the
republicans

admitted
before
the


chamber
of
deputies
on
february




that
the
people
of
france
were


more
heavily
taxed
at
that
time

than
those
of
any
other
country
in
the


world


he
put
the
taxation
of
england
at

francs
a
head

of
the


united
states
at

francs
a
head

of
germany
at

francs
a
head

and


of
france
at

francs
a
head






and
to
day
the
french
people
are
more
heavily
taxed
than
they
were
in




the
mere
general
expenses
of
collecting
the
revenue
of
france
are


set
down
in
the
budget
for

m

de
witt
represents
the
canton
of
castel
moron
in
the
council
general


of
the
lot
et
garonne

and
he
is
mayor
of
the
commune
of
laparade

at


the
legislative
elections
of
last
year

he
contested
the
representation


of
the
nerac
district
with
m

fallieres

the
minister
of
public


instruction

and
was
defeated

receiving


votes
against


given


to
the
minister

m

fallieres

on
the
stump


speaking
with
the


authority
of
a
minister
of

public
instruction


actually
assured
the


electors
that
to
vote
for
m

de
witt
was
to
vote
to

re
establish


seignorial
rights

and
to
bring
on
a
german
or

cossack

invasion


one


result
of
this
was

that
m

de
witt
was
burned
in
effigy
near
tonneins


after
the
election






after
the
election
of
m

de
witt
as
mayor
of
laparade

he
was
accused


before
the
tribunal
at
marmande
of

corrupting

the
electors
of
the


commune

the
accusation
rested
on

conversations


but
the
tribunal


sentenced
m

de
witt
to
a
fine
of
a
thousand
francs

and
several
of
his


electors
to
smaller
fines

they
all
appealed
to
the
court
at
agen

where


the
case
was
pleaded
by
m

piou

deputy
for
the
haute
garonne
and
one
of


the
ablest
barristers
in
southern
france






it
throws
an
interesting
light
on
the
present
condition
of
political


life
in
france

that
m

de
witt

though
the
sentence
of
the
tribunal
at


marmande
was
not
sustained

had
eventually
to
pay
a
fine
of

francs


on
the
ground
that
he
had
been
guilty
of

excessive
charity

to
an
old


man
of


named
sauvean

who
had
long
been
a
pensioner
of
his
family



the
wonder
is
that
his
commission
as
mayor
by
the
choice
of
his


fellow
citizens
was
not
revoked
by
the
ministry
at
paris

under
the


third
republic
this
is
no
uncommon
thing






early
in
the
year


m

duboscq

mayor
of
the
commune
of
labrit
in


the
landes

one
of
the
many
out
of
the
way
and
charming
places
which
in


that
part
of
france
are
associated
with
the
memory
of
henri
iv


gave
a


dinner
to
m

lambert
de
ste

croix

the
distinguished
monarchist
leader



who
died
not
long
ago

for
this
offence

m

lambert
de
ste

croix
having


just
then
exasperated
the
republicans
beyond
measure
by
a
vigorous


speech
made
at
dax
on
the
adour

m

duboscq
was
actually
suspended
from


his
office
by
order
of
m

floquet

now
the
president
of
the
chamber
of


deputies

in
reply
to
a
question
on
the
subject
put
by
a
deputy

m



lamarzelle

m

floquet
calmly
replied
that
lie
had
suspended
m

duboscq


because


being
a
functionary
of
the
government

he
had
departed
from


the
reserve
proper
in
his
position
by
inviting
an
opponent
of
the


government
to
dinner


the
mayors
of
these
communes

be
it
observed

are


elected
by
the
people

not
appointed
by
the
government

so
that
under


the
practice
of
the
french
republic

as
represented
by
the
present


president
of
the
chamber

a
radical
mayor
of
newcastle
who
should
ask


mr

gladstone
to
dinner
ought
to
be

suspended

at
once
by
lord


salisbury

this
is
municipal
liberty
in
france
under
the
third
republic






as
the
legislative
elections
are
conducted
under
the
supervision
of
the


mayors

the
object
of
such
performances
as
these
is
obvious
enough

at


the
same
time
with
m

duboscq

m

davezac
de
moran

mayor
of
siest
near


dax

was
also
suspended
by
m

floquet
for
the
offence
of
allowing
the


meeting
of
the
monarchical
committees

at
which
m

lambert
de
ste

croix


made
his
speech

to
be
held
in
his
own
house
at
dax


if
you
think




said
m

lamarzelle
to
the
minister


to
frighten
us
with
all
this

you


are
mistaken

at
your
age
robespierre
had
got
himself
guillotined




during
the
legislative
elections
of


the
school
teachers

the


postmen

the
gendarmes

the

supervisors
and
the

were


ordered
to
vote
against

monarchist
candidates


m

elected
in
the
calvados

publicly
stated
this
in
the

matin


and


without
contradiction

during
the
same
elections
the
cures
were


officially
forbidden
to
advise
their
people
to
vote
for

friends
of


religion


and
those
who
did
so
advise
were
fined

is
one
of
the
most
active
and
indefatigable


promoters
of
what
are
known
as
the

conferences
du
sud
ouest


these
are


meetings
of
the
monarchists
organised
on
a
systematic
plan

which
take


place
at
brief
intervals
throughout
the
great
departments
of


south
western
france
under
the
superintendence
of
a
society
of
which
m



princeteau

a
very
influential
and
intelligent
citizen
of
bordeaux

is


the
president

m

princeteau

like
m

de
witt

is
not
only
an


indefatigable
organiser

but
an
extremely
popular
and
effective
orator



and
it
is
a
curious
proof
of
the
efficiency
of
the
conservative


machinery
in
south
western
france

that
at
the
legislative
elections
of



the
radicals
and
the
socialists
completely
disappeared
as
parties


from
the
contest
in
the
gironde

thanks
to
the

scrutin


d
arrondissement


several
seats
from
that
department
which
ought
to


have
gone
to

monarchists

kept
by
the
government

but
upon
the


total
poll
the
monarchists
and
revisionists
show


votes
against




given
to
the
government
republicans

under
the

scrutin
de
liste



the
eleven
seats
for
the
gironde
would
pretty
plainly
have
gone
in



to
the
monarchists

in

m

cazauvielle

the
leading
republican


deputy

received


votes

or


more
than
the
republican
total


in


as
in

the
total
poll
amounted
to


votes

and
in



to



it
is
clear
that
the
republican
strength
fell
off

and


that
the
monarchist
strength
increased
in
the
gironde
between

m

princeteau
told
me
that
on
july

he
gave
a
fete
in
his
grounds
near


bordeaux
to
more
than
five
thousand
working
people

while
the
fete
was


going
on

a
procession
of
republicans
with
bands
of
music

bent
on


celebrating
the
fete
of
the
bastille

passed
the
grounds
more
than
once


with
the
obvious
intent
of
drawing
away
some
of
his
guests

this
they


completely
failed
to
do

if
the

fete
of
the
bastille

was
celebrated
at


bordeaux
as
it
was
at
nimes

this
says
as
much
for
the
good
taste
as
for


the
sound
politics
of
the
bordeaux
workmen

at
nimes
on
july


more


than
a
week
after
the

anniversary


i
found
the
city
streets
made


perilous
during
the
day
and
life
made
intolerable
at
night
by
such
a


clamour
of
chorus
singers
and
such
a
clatter
of
fireworks
as
i
had
not


supposed
it
possible
could
be
got
up
beyond
the
domain
of
our
own



glorious
and
immortal

american
fourth
of
july

several
accidents
were


caused
by

serpents

and
other
fireworks

and
when
i
asked
a
staid
and


sober
citizen
of
this
old
protestant
capital
why
the
law
permitted
such


performances

he
quietly
answered


the
law
does
not
permit
them

the


authorities
have
formally
forbidden
them

but
the
authorities
are


elective

and
they
are
more
anxious
to
keep
their
places
than
to
keep


the
peace


to
my
question
whether
the
extreme
radicals
were
very
strong


in
nimes

he
replied
that
nearly
a
fourth
of
the
republicans
of
nimes


are
avowed
socialists

mostly
of
the
anti
boulangist
anti
possibilist


type

one
of
their
candidates
for
a
legislative
seat
announced
his


intention

if
elected

to
give
some
person

to
be
designated
by
his


constituents

an
order
for
one
half
of
his
legislative
salary

to
be


drawn
regularly

and
applied

by
his
committee
to
political
purposes




his
political
programme
included
the
formal
abolition
of
the
presidency



annual
legislative
elections

the
nationalisation
of
the
soil
of
france



the
abolition
of
the
regular
army

the
socialisation
of
all
the
means
of


production

gratuitous
and
obligatory
education
on
the
same
lines
for


all
the
children
of
france

and
through
all
the
degrees
of
education



and
the
suppression
of
the
right
to
bequeath
or
to
inherit
property
of


any
kind


on
the
latter
point
a
rather
intelligent
socialist
with
whom


i
made
acquaintance
while
i
was
visiting
the
fine
roman
amphitheatre
at


nimes

and
whom
i
took
to
be
a
skilled
mechanic

was
very
explicit

he


thought
property
a

privilege

and
therefore
inconsistent
with
equality



he
spoke
in
an
oracular
fashion

and
he
probably
belonged
to
the
class


known
among
french
workmen

not
as


sublimes



but
as


les
fils
de


dieu




of
what
use


he
said


is
it
to
abolish
hereditary
titles
if


you
allow
a
man
of
one
generation
to
give
his
son
in
the
next
generation


the
more
serious
advantage
over
his
fellow
of
a
property
which
he
has


done
nothing
and
could
do
nothing
to
create


i
asked
him
if
he
agreed


with
st

just
that

opulence
is
an
infamy


he
replied
very
seriously




yes

i
think
if
st

just
said
that
he
said
the
truth

certainly
i
do


not
say
that
every
rich
man
is
infamous

that
is
another
matter

but
it


is
infamous
that
in
a
land
of
equality
one
man
should
have
the
means
to


give
himself
pleasures
and
execute
achievements
beyond
his


fellow
citizens


he
told
me
that
he
lived
in
alais

where
he
said
the


socialists
of
his
type
were
much
stronger
than
in
nimes

the
legislative


elections
show
that
lie
was
right
as
to
this

the
socialists
carried
the


first
division
of
alais

throwing


votes
against


radicals
and




government
republicans

for
the
government
republicans
my
friend


of
the
amphitheatre
could
find
no
words
of
contempt
strong
enough




they
are
all
whitewashed
wilsons


he
said

and
then
he
dilated
with


much
eloquence
on
the
case
of
a
certain
m

hude

a
great
friend
of


rochefort

he
scornfully
exclaimed


who
is
a
great
friend
of
boulanger




ah

voila
du
propre


he
is
a
wine
merchant

of
course
he
is
fond
of


the

pots
de
vin


the
french
phrase
for
bribes
taken
to
promote
jobs





and
thus

when
the
chemical
officers
go
to
verify
the
quality
of
his


wines

he
calls
in
the
prefect
of
police
to
prevent
it

because
he
is
a


deputy


he
was
particularly
bitter

too

on
the
conversion
by
the


republicans
of
more
than
a
thousand
millions
of
francs
lying
in
the


savings
banks
into

per
cent

funds


what
right
had
they
to
do
this




he
said
indignantly


it
was
a
trick
to
enslave
the
depositors







in
the
first
division
of
nimes
the
socialists
showed
no
great
strength


at
the
elections
of


the
monarchists
far
outnumbered
them

but
they


threw
votes
enough
to
make
the
election
very
close

the
republicans


numbering



the
socialists



and
the
monarchists



so


that
the
latter
won
the
day
by
no
more
than
fifty
seven
votes

that
they


won
it
is
due
to
the
cordial
co
operation
of
the
protestants
with
the


catholics
on
the
question
of
religious
liberty
in
support
of
a
catholic



m

de
bernis

who
had
twice
been
condemned
to
imprisonment
for



assisting

catholic
teachers
thrown
on
the
world
by
the

laicization



of
the
schools
of
nimes

this
co
operation
began
in


the


protestants
of
the
gard
have
quite
as
much
at
stake
in
this
conflict
as


the
catholics

the
protestant
seminaries
are
cut
down
like
the
catholic



the
appropriations
formerly
made
in
aid
of
new
protestant
parishes
are


made
no
longer

no
sums
are
allowed
for
protestant
missionary
work
in


outlying
districts

the
protestant
consistories
have
been
deprived
of


their
right
to
nominate
candidates
for
examination
as
teachers

the


consistories
and
the
councils
of
the
elders
are
no
longer
allowed
to


receive
and
administer
legacies
for
the
relief
of
the
poor

for


hospitals
or
asylums

formerly

where
no
manse
existed
in
a
commune

the


protestant
minister
was
allowed
a
certain
sum
for
lodgings

this
has


been
stopped

in
short

the
protestants

like
the
catholics
of
france



find
themselves
treated
by
an
oligarchy
of
irreligious
fanatics
as


pariahs
in
their
own
country

the
protestants

like
the
catholics

are


driven
into
irreconcilable
hostility
against
the
republic
by
a


parliamentary
majority
which
treats
all
religious
questions
in
the


spirit
of
m

de
mortillet

mayor
of
st

germain

and
a
radical
deputy


for
the
seine
et
oise

in

some
speaker
in
the
chamber
appealed
in


the
course
of
his
speech
to
the
law
of
god


the
law
of
god


broke
in


m

de
mortillet


pray

what
is
god







the
more
completely
this
spirit
of
the
mayor
of
st

germian
gets
the


control
of
the
republican
party

the
more
obvious
it
becomes
that
the


republic
must
gravitate
into
socialism






as
it
steadily
alienates
from
itself
the
vast
multitudes
of
frenchmen


who
are
either
religious
men

or
recognise
the
vital
importance
of


religious
institutions
to
the
existing
social
order

it
is
compelled
to


court
the
alliance
of
the
avowed
enemies
of
the
existing
social
order



this
is
strikingly
illustrated
in
the
political
condition
of
the
great


southern
department
of
the
bouches
du
rhone

this
department
offers
a


most
instructive
contrast
with
the
calvados






in
the
bouches
du
rhone

the
government
republicans
were
as
badly
beaten


in

as
in
the
calvados

but
in
the
calvados
they
were
beaten
by
the


monarchists

and
in
the
bouches
du
rhone
by
the
radicals
and
the


socialists






in
the
bouches
du
rhone
the
radicals
and
socialists
threw


votes



the
government
republicans
no
more
than



marseilles

the
greatest


commercial
city
in
france

a
city
of

republicans
before
the
republic




with
traditions
which
give
dignity
to
its
democratic
tendencies



repudiated
the
republic
of
m

jules
ferry
and
m

carnot
as
emphatically


as
the
monarchical
morbihan

even
the
boulangists
were
nearly
twice
as


strong

and
the
monarchists
were
more
than
twice
as
strong
in
marseilles


as
the
opportunist
republicans

the
boulangists
threw
there



and


the
monarchists


votes

the
strength
of
the
boulangists
gives
zest


to
a
terse
verdict
upon
the


brav

general


which
i
heard
delivered
by


a

cocher

in
marseilles
on
the
eve
of
the
famous
january
elections
in


paris

passing
through
one
of
the
squares
of
the
mediterranean
city

i


observed
two

cochers

engaged
in
an
animated
debate

one
of
them
from


his
box
exclaimed

i
tell
you
boulanger
is
the
only
real
man
in
france




to
which
the
other
replied
as
vehemently


and
i
tell
you
that
he
is


nothing
but
the
dealer
in
a
low
political
hell


c
est
un
croupier
de


mauvais
aloi



he
may
have
picked
up
the
phrase
from
the

petit


marseillais


which
is
one
of
the
few
really
well
edited
newspapers
in


france

but
it
was
a
notable
phrase

and
it
expresses

i
think

the


opinion
of
the
sincere
radicals
and
socialists

not
only
as
to
general


boulanger

but
as
to
the
politicians

now
his
bitterest
enemies

who


were
his
original
friends
and

promoters


a
very
smart
and
outspoken


provencal
socialist
who
drove
me
on
a
delightful
morning
from
the
once


royal
and
always
delectable
city
of
arles
to
the
majestic
ruins
of


montmajeur

and
the
unique
and
wonderful
deserted
fortress
city
of
les


baux

set
no
bounds
to
his
speech
about
the
official
republicans

we
met


near
montmajeur
a
neat
private
carriage


that
is
the
carriage
of


m






he
said

as
we
passed
on


he
is
an
aristocrat

but
i
think
he


will
be
mayor
of
axles

we
have
had
an
aristocratic
major
who
gave
to


the
people

and
a
republican
mayor
who
took
from
the
people

i
prefer


the
aristocrat

till
we
can
make
an
end
of
all
majors
and
all
this


rubbish
of
governments


at
the
legislative
elections
the
monarchists
of


aries
threw


votes

the
radicals



and
the
government


republicans
none
at
all

of
course
the
radical
members
support
the


government

but
on
their
own
terms

as
these
terms
grow
more
exacting



the
strength
of
the
monarchist
reaction
increases

and
as
the


monarchists
grow
stronger
the
radical
exactions
become
more
imperious



the
most
active
and
earnest
monarchist
whom
i
met
in
marseilles

m



fournier

assures
me
that
the
marseilles
radicals
are
more
intolerant
of


the
opportunists
than
they
are
even
of
the
monarchists






as
one
of
the
largest
employers
of
labour
in
marseilles

m

fournier
is


in
constant
touch
with
the
working
population
of
the
bouches
du
rhone



he
is
an
earnest
and
devoted
catholic

and
he
has
encouraged
the


foundation
of
a
christian
corporation
among
the
people
employed
in
his


works

these
works
were
founded
half
a
century
ago

in


for
the


purpose
of
turning
to
practical
results
the
interesting
discoveries
then


made
by
m

chevreuil

the
famous
centenarian
dean
of
french
science

as


to
the
nature
and
properties
of
fatty
substances

at
the
outset
these


works
were
taken
up
with
the
manufacture
of
stearine
candles

but
as
in


the
case
of
the
glass
works
of
st

gobain

the
chemical
processes


employed
in
creating
one
particular
product
were
soon
found
to
yield


other
very
different
and
not
less
valuable
results

i
shall
not
attempt


to
enter
into
the
mysteries
of
saponification
and
distillation

which


cease
to
be
mysteries
when
they
are
followed
up
from
point
to
point


through
the
extensive
and
orderly
organisation
of
the
fournier
works



suffice
it
that
at
these
works

men
and

women
are
busily
employed


in
turning
every
year


tons
of
african
palm
oil

and
of


australian

russian

french

and
american
tallow
into
stearine
candles



oleine

and
glycerine

the
output
is
enormous

amounting
annually
to





packets
of
candles
of
an
average
weight
of

grammes
a


packet

to



kilogrammes
of
oleine

and
to



kilogrammes


of
glycerine

how
much
of
this
latter
product
goes
to
the
pharmacies
and


how
much
to
the
powder
magazines
of
the
world
it
is
not
easy
to
say

but


it
is
easy
to
see
that
if
the
bouches
du
rhone
get
the
better
of
the


calvados
in
the
politics
of
france

there
will
be
a
serious
falling
off


in
the
demand
for
altar
lights
and
chamber
candles

and
a
still
more


serious
increase
in
the
demand
for
nitro
glycerine






the
output
of
the
fournier
works
represents
about
one
fourth
of
the


whole
stearine
and
glycerine
production
of
france

and
as
paraffin
has


of
late
years
largely
taken
the
place
of
stearine
in
the
famous
price


works
in
england

the
fournier
works
are
now
doubtless
the
most


important
of
their
kind
in
the
world

thirty
years
ago
the
candles


produced
here
were
almost
all
exported

now
the
home
consumption
just


about
equals
the
exportation

a
fact
as
to
which
the
truly
paternal


government
of
france
takes
pains
to
leave
no
doubt
in
the
minds
of
the


producers
by
taxing
candles
heavily
as
an

article
of
luxury


they
are


subjected
to
a
regie
like
cigars

and
to
the
octroi

and
these
imposts



m

fournier
tells
me

now
amount
to
about
fifty
per
cent

of
their


value

a
knowledge
of
this
circumstance
may

perhaps

divert
the
wrath


of
travellers
in
france
from
the
hotel
keeper

who
claps
a
couple
of


francs
for
bougies
into
your
bill
if
you
pass
half
a
summer
s
day
in
his


house

to
the
government
which
concerns
itself
much
more
actively
with


squeezing
percentages
out
of
the
industries
than
with
balancing
the


national
budgets
of
france

must
not
all
taxes
be
paid
by
the
ultimate


consumer

what
with
these
taxes
and
with
the
higher
wage
of
labour
in


france

the
stearine
works
of
marseilles
find
themselves
taken
at


advantage
by
the
energetic
manufacturers
of
holland

in
the
fournier


works
the
average
workman
earns
a
daily
wage
of
from

frs


c

to



frs


c


the
average
workwomen

who
do
chiefly
the
clean
and
even


pretty
work
of
moulding
the

making
them
up
into
packets

in


large

very
well
ventilated
and
well
ordered
rooms

earn
an
average


daily
wage
of

frs


c

both
men
and
women
work
about
ten
hours
a


day

the

eight
hours

doctrine
of
the
political
socialists
finds
no


more
favour
here
with
the
real
working
people
apparently
than
elsewhere


in
france

in
holland
and
belgium
and
at
roubaix
the
average
wage
is


about
one
franc
less
for
both
sexes






the
christian
corporation
of
the
fournier
works
is
organised
upon
the


principles

but
not
exactly
upon
the
lines

of
the
harmel
system

it
is


formed
by
a
union
of
five
religious
associations
among
the
workpeople



made
up
of
the
men

the
married
women

the
young
men

the
young
girls



and
the
children

character
and
conduct
are
the
conditions
of


membership

and
under
the
direction
of
a
general
council
in
which
the


employers
take
an
active
part

the
corporation
has
founded
and


administers
for
the
common
benefit
a
consumers

society
which
maintains


an
economical
kitchen
with
refectories

a
recreation
hall
with
a
bar




not
limited
to
soda
water

lemonade

and
tea


and
a
circulating


library

the
statutes
of
this
society
leave
the
members
a
wide
range
of


liberty

and
the
managers
are
chosen
by
the
members

of
the
profits
five


per
cent
first
go
to
the
reserve
fund

dividends
may
then
be
declared
of


not
more
than
ten
per
cent

on
the
capital
stock
of


francs

and


the
surplus

if
any

forms
a
supplementary
reserve

the
economical


kitchen
is
so
well
managed
that
it
gives
a
customer

who
must
be


employed
in
the
works

but
need
not
be
a
member
of
the
association

for



centimes

or
a
little
more
than
fivepence

a
bowl
of
soup

a
large


helping
of
meat
and
vegetables

half
a
pound
of
bread

and
a
third
of
a


bottle
of
wine

a
cafe
cognac

and
the
cognac
good

may
be
had
for



centimes
more






in
august
of
last
year

with
the
help
of
the
owners
of
the
works

a


musical
society
was
established

and
the
workpeople
are
furnished


gratuitously
with
medical
advice
and
medicines

to
these

in
the
case
of


invalid
workmen
who
have
been
for
two
years
employed
in
the
works

is


added
a
weekly
allowance
of
six
francs
during
illness

the
owners
have


also
founded
a
savings
bank
which
pays
six
per
cent

on
sums
below




francs

and
four
per
cent

on
sums
above
that
amount

these
are
open
to


all
the
workpeople
employed
in
the
works

whether
members
or
not
of
the


christian
corporation






in
this
fashion
m

fournier

and
other
devout
and
practical
catholics
of


the
bouches
du
rhone
are
fighting
the
republic
by
fighting
the


socialistic
radicalism
of
which
their
department
is
the
true


headquarters

and
to
which
the
republic
has
substantially
surrendered



it
is
visibly
an
uphill
fight
in
the
bouches
du
rhone

and
in


south
eastern
france
generally

but
there
is
life
in
the
convictions


which
nerve
men
to
fight
an
uphill
fight

and
there
is
something
in
the


fire
and
spirit
of
these
militant
catholics
of
france
which
reminds
one


of
prudentius

the
pindar
of
christian
spain

celebrating
fifteen


centuries
ago
the
believers
who
upheld
so
manfully
the
rights
of


conscience
against
praetors
and
prefects
bent
on
converting
them
to
the


beauty
of

moral
unity



quod
princeps
colit
ut
colamus
omnes







when
two
men
ride
on
a
horse
the
man
who
holds
the
bridle
is
the
master



and
the
radicals
hold
the
bridle
of
the
french
government

the
radical


department
of
the
bouches
du
rhone
represents
the
republic

the


monarchist
department
of
the
calvados
represents
france

if
the
republic


wins

the
history
of
france
before

will
be
wiped
out
as
with
a


sponge

and
with
it
all
the
great
qualities
of
the
french
people
must


disappear

without
an
executive

without
a
past

and
without
a
religion



france
would
become
the
ideal
nation
of
the
nihilists






if
france
wins

if
she
recovers
the
executive
unity
and
stability


essential
to
her
life
as
a
nation

recovers
the
historic
sense
of
her


national
growth
into
greatness

recovers
for
every
man

woman

and
child


in
france
the
simple
human
right
to
believe
and
to
hope

then
the


republic
must
inevitably
vanish

for
with
all
these
things
the
republic


has
made
itself
incompatible






if
these
were
only
my
own
conclusions

drawn
from
all
that
i
saw
and


heard
and
learned
in
france
during
the
year


i
might
hesitate
to


adopt
them
as
adequate
and
final






but
how
can
i
hesitate

when
i
find
these
conclusions
of
mine
not


obscurely
foreshadowed
as
impending
in

by
ernest
renan

and


re
affirmed
as
imminent
in

by
jules
simon







the
edifice
of
our
chimaeras


cried
ernest
renan
in





has


melted
away
like
fairy
castles
in
a
dream

presumption

puerile
vanity

insubordination

feather
headedness



inability
to
grasp
many
different
ideas
at
a
glance

want
of
scientific


sense

simple
and
stupid
ignorance

here
is
the
summary
of
our
history


for
a
year




the
opposition

which
pretended
to
have
revolutionary


remedies
for
all
possible
ills

has
found
itself
at
the
end
of
a
few


days
as
unpopular
as
the
fallen
dynasty

the
republican
party

puffed
up


with
the
fatal
errors
which
for
half
a
century
have
been
current
as
to


the
history
of
the
revolution

and
which
imagined
itself
able
to
play


over
again
a
game
won
eighty
years
ago
only
through
circumstances


utterly
unlike
those
of
to
day

has
learned
that
it
was
a
lunatic
taking


visions
for
realities

the
legend
of
the
empire
has
been
slain
by


napoleon
iii

the
legend
of

has
been
done
to
death
by
m

gambetta



the
legend
of
the
terror

for
even
the
terror
had
its
legend
among
us




has
been
hideously
parodied
by
the
commune







so
cried
m

renan
in








our
worst
disasters


said
m

jules
simon
in





have
so
far


broken
out
only
where
great
numbers
of
men
are
crowded
together

men


begin
with
scepticism

from
scepticism
they
go
on
rapidly
to
nihilism



and
from
nihilism
to
social
war

the
labourer
in
the
fields
still
has


his
faith

he
still
has
his
hope
of
another
life

he
has
not
yet


unlearned
the
name
of
god

when
he
becomes
a
nihilist
we
shall
have
the


commune
in
our
cities

and
beyond
them
the
jacqueries

it
is
impossible


that
the
authorities
should
not
see
this

but
the
authorities
obey
the


deputy

the
deputy
obeys
the
elector

and
the
elector
obeys
the


agitator















dieu

liberte


par
jules
simon

paris









there
will
soon
be
only
two
parties
left
in
france

the
party
of
the


dynamiters

and
the
party
of
the
do
nothings

whatever
moderate


republicans
are
left
must
go
over
either
to
violence
or
to


indifference

is
it
france
alone
which
is
thus
threatened

it
is
the


world

the
communists
and
the
fenians
were
not
produced
in
france

but


france
attracts
them







the
liberty
you
pretend
to
be
establishing
is
oppression

the
neutral


education
you
propose
is
the
suppression
of
the
human
heart

of
the


human
conscience







this

clericalism

which
you
declare
to
be
the
enemy

and
which

when


you
are
pushed
to
the
wall

turns
out
to
be
christianity

this



clericalism

which
you
attack
and
mean
to
exterminate

tell
me

is
this


the
power
which
lays
your
ministers
prostrate
before
your
deputies

and


your
deputies
prostrate
before
their
electors

is
it

clericalism

which


is
stirring
up
labour
against
capital

is
it

clericalism

which


preaches
and
supports

strikes


is
it

clericalism

which
manufactures


dynamite
and
blows
up
houses

is
it

clericalism

which
is
transforming


your
literature
into
ribaldry
and
your
theatres
into
brothels

is
it



clericalism

which
shuts
up
your
schools

is
it

clericalism

which


transforms
all
the
actions
and
relations
of
life
into
matters
of


contract
and
of
calculation

do
you
imagine
that
christianity

if
it
be


your
enemy

is
an
enemy
as
terrible
as
nihilism

and
what
other
end
but


nihilism
can
there
be
of
your

neutral

obligatory
schools
and
your


atheistic
laws

already
you
go
in
fear
of
the
very
phrase
which


recognises
the
duties
of
man
to
god

you
think
it
dangerous

you
think


it
equivocal

you
do
not
know
that
when
you
recoil
before
the
name
of


god
you
abandon
the
traditions
of
france







nay

you
will
not
even
hear

is


another

dangerous


another

equivocal

you
talk
now
in

about
the

civic

of
man

for
when

are

there
will
be
no
danger
of
confounding
the
monarchical
france
before




which
we
must
learn
to
hate

with
the
republican
france
which
we


must
love

civic

brought
france
in

to
the

law
of


suspects


to
the
headlong
and
brutal
demolition
of
the

edifice

to

to

to
what
